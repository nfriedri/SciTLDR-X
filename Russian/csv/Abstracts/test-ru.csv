"Incremental class learning involves sequentially learning classes in bursts of examples from the same class.This violates the assumptions that underlie  methods for training standard deep neural networks, and will cause them to suffer from catastrophic forgetting.Arguably, the best method for incremental class learning is iCaRL, but it requires storing  training examples for each class, making it challenging to scale.Here, we propose FearNet for incremental class learning.FearNet is a generative model that does not store previous examples, making it memory efficient.FearNet uses a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex.Memory consolidation is inspired by mechanisms that occur during sleep.FearNet also uses a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall.

"Deep learning algorithms have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in various tasks such as image classification.This problem was addressed by employing several defense methods for detection and rejection of particular types of attacks.However, training and manipulating networks according to particular defense schemes increases computational complexity of the learning algorithms.In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adversarial attacks by using data dependent adaptive convolution kernels.To this end, we propose a new type of HyperNetwork in order to employ statistical properties of input data and features for computation of statistical adaptive maps.Then, we filter convolution weights of CNNs with the learned statistical maps to compute dynamic kernels.Thereby, weights and kernels are collectively optimized for learning of image classification models robust toadversarial attacks without employment of additional target detection and rejection algorithms.We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enables CNNs to spontaneously defend against different types of attacks, e.g. attacks generated by Gaussian noise, fast gradient sign methods (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and a black-box attack (Narodytska & Kasiviswanathan, 2016).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],rkeDJ04Mf,HyperNetworks with statistical filtering for defending adversarial examples,Мы модифицировали CNN с использованием гиперсетей и отметили лучшую устойчивость к неблагоприятным примерам.

"This paper addresses the problem of evaluating learning systems in safety critical domains such as autonomous driving, where failures can have catastrophic consequences.We focus on two problems: searching for scenarios when learned agents fail and assessing their probability of failure.The standard method for agent evaluation in reinforcement learning, Vanilla Monte Carlo, can miss failures entirely, leading to the deployment of unsafe agents.We demonstrate this is an issue for current agents, where even matching the compute used for training is sometimes insufficient for evaluation.To address this shortcoming, we draw upon the rare event probability estimation literature and propose an adversarial evaluation approach.Our approach focuses evaluation on adversarially chosen situations, while still providing unbiased estimates of failure probabilities.The key difficulty is in identifying these adversarial situations -- since failures are rare there is little signal to drive optimization.To solve this we propose a continuation approach that learns failure modes in related but less robust agents.Our approach also allows reuse of data already collected for training the agent.We demonstrate the efficacy of adversarial evaluation on two standard domains: humanoid control and simulated driving.Experimental results show that our methods can find catastrophic failures and estimate failures rates of agents multiple orders of magnitude faster than standard evaluation schemes, in minutes to hours rather than days.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],B1xhQhRcK7,Rigorous Agent Evaluation: An Adversarial Approach to Uncover Catastrophic Failures,"Мы показываем, что редкие, но катастрофические сбои могут быть полностью пропущены при случайном тестировании, что создает проблемы для безопасного развертывания.

"The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular combination of deep latent variable model and accompanying variational learning technique.By using a neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods.In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior.In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics.We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target.As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs.Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update.Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work.Empirically, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding collapse while being substantially faster.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],rylDfnCqF7,Lagging Inference Networks and Posterior Collapse in Variational Autoencoders,"Для решения проблемы апостериорного коллапса в VAE мы предлагаем новую, но простую процедуру обучения, которая агрессивно оптимизирует сеть вывода с большим количеством обновлений.

"Knowledge distillation is a potential solution for model compression.The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one.Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network.However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered.To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification.By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks.Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates.In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification.Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rJFOptp6Z,Model Distillation with Knowledge Transfer from Face Classification to Alignment and Verification,Мы берем распознавание лиц в качестве переломного момента и предлагаем дистилляцию моделей с передачей знаний от классификации лиц к выравниванию и проверке.

"The ability to look multiple times through a series of pose-adjusted glimpses is fundamental to human vision.This critical faculty allows us to understand highly complex visual scenes.Short term memory plays an integral role in aggregating the information obtained from these glimpses and informing our interpretation of the scene.Computational models have attempted to address glimpsing and visual attention but have failed to incorporate the notion of memory.We introduce a novel, biologically inspired visual working memory architecture that we term the Hebb-Rosenblatt memory.We subsequently introduce a fully differentiable Short Term Attentive Working Memory model (STAWM) which uses transformational attention to learn a memory over each image it sees.The state of our Hebb-Rosenblatt memory is embedded in STAWM as the weights space of a layer.By projecting different queries through this layer we can obtain goal-oriented latent representations for tasks including classification and visual reconstruction.Our model obtains highly competitive classification performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10.As demonstrated through the CelebA dataset, to perform reconstruction the model learns to make a sequence of updates to a canvas which constitute a parts-based representation.Classification with the self supervised representation obtained from MNIST is shown to be in line with the state of the art models (none of which use a visual attention mechanism).Finally, we show that STAWM can be trained under the dual constraints of classification and reconstruction to provide an interpretable visual sketchpad which helps open the `black-box' of deep learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],B1fbosCcYm,A Biologically Inspired Visual Working Memory for Deep Networks,"Биологически вдохновленная рабочая память, которая может быть интегрирована в рекуррентные модели зрительного внимания для достижения современного уровня производительности"

"Generative models have been successfully applied to image style transfer and domain translation.However, there is still a wide gap in the quality of results when learning such tasks on musical audio.Furthermore, most translation models only enable one-to-one or one-to-many transfer by relying on separate encoders or decoders and complex, computationally-heavy models.In this paper, we introduce the Modulated Variational auto-Encoders (MoVE) to perform musical timbre transfer.First, we define timbre transfer as applying parts of the auditory properties of a musical instrument onto another.We show that we can achieve and improve this task by conditioning existing domain translation techniques with Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM).Then, by replacing the usual adversarial translation criterion by a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) objective, we alleviate the need for an auxiliary pair of discriminative networks.This allows a faster and more stable training, along with a controllable latent space encoder.By further conditioning our system on several different instruments, we can generalize to many-to-many transfer within a single variational architecture able to perform multi-domain transfers.Our models map inputs to 3-dimensional representations, successfully translating timbre from one instrument to another and supporting sound synthesis on a reduced set of control parameters.We evaluate our method in reconstruction and generation tasks while analyzing the auditory descriptor distributions across transferred domains.We show that this architecture incorporates generative controls in multi-domain transfer, yet remaining rather light, fast to train and effective on small datasets.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJgOl3AqY7,Modulated Variational Auto-Encoders for Many-to-Many Musical Timbre Transfer,"В статье используется вариационное автокодирование и сетевое кондиционирование для передачи музыкальных тембров, мы развиваем и обобщаем нашу архитектуру для передачи от многих ко многим инструментам вместе с визуализацией и оценками."

"Reasoning over text and Knowledge Bases (KBs) is a major challenge for Artificial Intelligence, with applications in machine reading, dialogue, and question answering. Transducing text to logical forms which can be operated on is a brittle and error-prone process. Operating directly on text by jointly learning representations and transformations thereof by means of neural architectures that lack the ability to learn and exploit general rules can be very data-inefficient and not generalise correctly. These issues are addressed by Neural Theorem Provers (NTPs) (Rocktäschel & Riedel, 2017), neuro-symbolic systems based on a continuous relaxation of Prolog’s backward chaining algorithm, where symbolic unification between atoms is replaced by a differentiable operator computing the similarity between their embedding representations. In this paper, we first propose Neighbourhood-approximated Neural Theorem Provers (NaNTPs) consisting of two extensions toNTPs, namelya) a method for drastically reducing the previously prohibitive time and space complexity during inference and learning, andb) an attention mechanism for improving the rule learning process, deeming them usable on real-world datasets.Then, we propose a novel approach for jointly reasoning over KB facts and textual mentions, by jointly embedding them in a shared embedding space.The proposed method is able to extract rules and provide explanations—involving both textual patterns and KB relations—from large KBs and text corpora.We show that NaNTPs perform on par with NTPs at a fraction of a cost, and can achieve competitive link prediction results on challenging large-scale datasets, including WN18, WN18RR, and FB15k-237 (with and without textual mentions) while being able to provide explanations for each prediction and extract interpretable rules.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJzmzn0ctX,Scalable Neural Theorem Proving on Knowledge Bases and Natural Language,"Мы масштабируем нейронные доказательства теорем на большие наборы данных, улучшаем процесс обучения правилам и расширяем его для совместного рассуждения над текстом и базами знаний."

"We investigate the methods by which a Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) learns concepts such as 'similar' and 'different' between pairs of images using a small training dataset and generalizes these concepts to previously unseen types of data.Specifically, we show that an RCN trained to identify relationships between image-pairs drawn from a subset of digits from the MNIST database or the depth maps of subset of visual scenes from a moving camera generalizes the learned transformations to images of digits unseen during training or depth maps of different visual scenes.We infer, using Principal Component Analysis, that the high dimensional reservoir states generated from an input image pair with a specific transformation converge over time to a unique relationship.Thus, as opposed to training the entire high dimensional reservoir state, the reservoir only needs to train on these unique relationships, allowing the reservoir to perform well with very few training examples.Thus, generalization of learning to unseen images is interpretable in terms of clustering of the reservoir state onto the attractor corresponding to the transformation in reservoir space.We find that RCNs can identify and generalize linear and non-linear transformations, and combinations of transformations, naturally and be a robust and effective image classifier.Additionally, RCNs perform significantly better than state of the art neural network classification techniques such as deep Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) in generalization tasks both on the MNIST dataset and more complex depth maps of visual scenes from a moving camera.This work helps bridge the gap between explainable machine learning and biological learning through analogies using small datasets, and points to new directions in the investigation of learning processes.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyFaiGbCW,Generalization of Learning using Reservoir Computing,"Обобщение связей, изученных между парами изображений с помощью небольшого количества обучающих данных, на ранее невиданные типы изображений с помощью объяснимой модели динамических систем, Reservoir Computing, и биологически правдоподобной техники обучения, основанной на аналогиях."

"In many robotic applications, it is crucial to maintain a belief about the state of a system, like the location of a robot or the pose of an object.These state estimates serve as input for planning and decision making and provide feedback during task execution.

"Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers.However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections.A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks.To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning.Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated.We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost.We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy.We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkEfPeZRb,Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning,"Новый алгоритм для снижения коммуникационных затрат при распределенном глубоком обучении путем различения ""нечетких"" градиентов."

"The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to enable a learner to imitate an expert’s behavior given the expert’s demonstrations.Recently, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has successfully achieved it even on complex continuous control tasks.However, GAIL requires a huge number of interactions with environment during training.We believe that IL algorithm could be more applicable to the real-world environments if the number of interactions could be reduced.To this end, we propose a model free, off-policy IL algorithm for continuous control.The keys of our algorithm are two folds:1) adopting deterministic policy that allows us to derive a novel type of policy gradient which we call deterministic policy imitation gradient (DPIG),2) introducing a function which we call state screening function (SSF) to avoid noisy policy updates with states that are not typical of those appeared on the expert’s demonstrations.Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve the goal of IL with at least tens of times less interactions than GAIL on a variety of continuous control tasks.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rJ3fy0k0Z,Deterministic Policy Imitation Gradient Algorithm,"Мы предлагаем алгоритм обучения имитации без модели, который способен уменьшить количество взаимодействий с окружающей средой по сравнению с современным алгоритмом обучения имитации, а именно GAIL."

"Convolution acts as a local feature extractor in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).However, the convolution operation is not applicable when the input data is supported on an irregular graph such as with social networks, citation networks, or knowledge graphs.This paper proposes the topology adaptive graph convolutional network (TAGCN), a novel graph convolutional network that generalizes CNN architectures to graph-structured data and provides a systematic way to design a set of fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs.The topologies of these filters are adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform convolution, replacing the square filter for the grid-structured data in traditional CNNs.The outputs are the weighted sum of these filters’ outputs, extraction of both vertex features and strength of correlation between vertices.Itcan be used with both directed and undirected graphs.The proposed TAGCN not only inherits the properties of convolutions in CNN for grid-structured data, but it is also consistent with convolution as defined in graph signal processing.Further, as no approximation to the convolution is needed, TAGCN exhibits better performance than existing graph-convolution-approximation methods on a numberof data sets.As only the polynomials of degree two of the adjacency matrix are used, TAGCN is also computationally simpler than other recent methods.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H113pWZRb,Topology Adaptive Graph Convolutional  Networks,Низкая вычислительная сложность графа CNN (без аппроксимации) с лучшей точностью классификации

"Somatic cancer mutation detection at ultra-low variant allele frequencies (VAFs) is an unmet challenge that is intractable with current state-of-the-art mutation calling methods.Specifically, the limit of VAF detection is closely related to the depth of coverage, due to the requirement of multiple supporting reads in extant methods, precluding the detection of mutations at VAFs that are orders of magnitude lower than the depth of coverage.Nevertheless, the ability to detect cancer-associated mutations in ultra low VAFs is a fundamental requirement for low-tumor burden cancer diagnostics applications such as early detection, monitoring, and therapy nomination using liquid biopsy methods (cell-free DNA).Here we defined a spatial representation of sequencing information adapted for convolutional architecture that enables variant detection at VAFs, in a manner independent of the depth of sequencing.This method enables the detection of cancer mutations even in VAFs as low as 10x-4^, >2 orders of magnitude below the current state-of-the-art.We validated our method on both simulated plasma and on clinical cfDNA plasma samples from cancer patients and non-cancer controls.This method introduces a new domain within bioinformatics and personalized medicine – somatic whole genome mutation calling for liquid biopsy.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1DkN7ZCZ,Deep learning mutation prediction enables early stage lung cancer detection in liquid biopsy," Существующие методы определения соматических мутаций не работают с жидкими биопсиями (т.е. с низким покрытием секвенирования), мы применяем архитектуру CNN для уникального представления чтения и его аилгнмента, мы показываем значительное улучшение по сравнению с предыдущими методами в условиях низкой частоты."

"Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away.This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds.Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations.Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the `  null space' of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities.The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network.To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn  memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing.Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],Syl3_2JCZ,A Self-Organizing Memory Network,Мы вывели биологически правдоподобные правила обучения синаптической пластичности для рекуррентной нейронной сети для хранения представлений стимулов.

We show how to address two main challenges that renders this method practical for large-scale deployment: 1) we propose a method for integrating error correction into the language model completion via a edit-distance potential and a variant of beam search that can exploit these potential functions; and2) we show how to efficiently perform CPU-based computation to complete the queries, with error correction, in real time (generating top 10 completions within 16 ms).Experiments show that the method substantially increases hit rate over standard approaches, and is capable of handling tail queries.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],By3VrbbAb,Realtime query completion via deep language models,"Авторы предлагают алгоритм для решения проблемы завершения запроса с исправлением ошибок, используют моделирование на основе RNN на уровне символов и оптимизируют часть вывода для достижения целей в реальном времени."
"RMSProp and ADAM continue to be extremely popular algorithms for training neural nets but their theoretical convergence properties have remained unclear.Further, recent work has seemed to suggest that these algorithms have worse generalization properties when compared to carefully tuned stochastic gradient descent or its momentum variants.In this work, we make progress towards a deeper understanding of ADAM and RMSProp in two ways.First, we provide proofs that these adaptive gradient algorithms are guaranteed to reach criticality for smooth non-convex objectives, and we give bounds on the running time.Next we design experiments to empirically study the convergence and generalization properties of RMSProp and ADAM against Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient method on a variety of common autoencoder setups and on VGG-9 with CIFAR-10.Through these experiments we demonstrate the interesting sensitivity that ADAM has to its momentum parameter \beta_1.We show that at very high values of the momentum parameter (\beta_1 = 0.99) ADAM outperforms a carefully tuned NAG on most of our experiments, in terms of getting lower training and test losses.On the other hand, NAG can sometimes do better when ADAM's \beta_1 is set to the most commonly used value: \beta_1 = 0.9, indicating the importance of tuning the hyperparameters of ADAM to get better generalization performance.We also report experiments on different autoencoders to demonstrate that NAG has better abilities in terms of reducing the gradient norms, and it also produces iterates which exhibit an increasing trend for the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss function at the iterates.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkgd0iA9FQ,Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and ADAM in Non-Convex Optimization and an Empirical Comparison to Nesterov Acceleration,В этой работе мы доказываем сходимость к критичности (стохастического и детерминированного) RMSProp и детерминированного ADAM для гладких невыпуклых задач и демонстрируем интересную чувствительность бета_1 для ADAM на автоэнкодерах.

"Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a new and largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems.We introduce a novel automated countermeasure called Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) to thwart the potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model.The proposed PCL methodology is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to build/train parallel checkpointing learners.We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network.To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint checkpointing modules are trained and leveraged to validate the victim model execution in parallel.Each checkpointing learner explicitly characterizes the geometry of the input data and the corresponding high-level data abstractions within a particular DL layer.As such, the adversary is required to simultaneously deceive all the defender modules in order to succeed.We extensively evaluate the performance of the PCL methodology against the state-of-the-art attack scenarios, including Fast-Gradient-Sign (FGS), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Deepfool, and Carlini&WagnerL2 algorithm.Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations for analyzing various data collections including MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed defense mechanism against adversarial samples.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],HyI6s40a-,Towards Safe Deep Learning: Unsupervised Defense Against Generic Adversarial Attacks,Разработка механизмов защиты от атак противников без наблюдения имеет решающее значение для обеспечения обобщаемости защиты.

"Neural architecture search (NAS) has a great impact by automatically designing effective neural network architectures.However, the prohibitive computational demand of conventional NAS algorithms (e.g. 10 4 GPU hours) makes it difficult to directly search the architectures on large-scale tasks (e.g. ImageNet).Differentiable NAS can reduce the cost of GPU hours via a continuous representation of network architecture but suffers from the high GPU memory consumption issue (grow linearly w.r.t. candidate set size).As a result, they need to utilize proxy tasks, such as training on a smaller dataset, or learning with only a few blocks, or training just for a few epochs.These architectures optimized on proxy tasks are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task.In this paper, we present ProxylessNAS that can directly learn the architectures for large-scale target tasks and target hardware platforms.We address the high memory consumption issue of differentiable NAS and reduce the computational cost (GPU hours and GPU memory) to the same level of regular training while still allowing a large candidate set.Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of directness and specialization.On CIFAR-10, our model achieves 2.08% test error with only 5.7M parameters, better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture AmoebaNet-B, while using 6× fewer parameters.On ImageNet, our model achieves 3.1% better top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2, while being 1.2× faster with measured GPU latency.We also apply ProxylessNAS to specialize neural architectures for hardware with direct hardware metrics (e.g. latency) and provide insights for efficient CNN architecture design.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HylVB3AqYm,ProxylessNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search on Target Task and Hardware,Поиск беспроксимальной нейронной архитектуры для прямого обучения архитектур на крупномасштабной целевой задаче (ImageNet) при снижении стоимости до уровня обычного обучения.

"Despite the recent successes in robotic locomotion control, the design of robot relies heavily on human engineering.Automatic robot design has been a long studied subject, but the recent progress has been slowed due to the large combinatorial search space and the difficulty in evaluating the found candidates.To address the two challenges, we formulate automatic robot design as a graph search problem and perform evolution search in graph space.We propose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE), which performs selection on current candidates and evolves new ones iteratively.Different from previous approaches, NGE uses graph neural networks to parameterize the control policies, which reduces evaluation cost on new candidates with the help of skill transfer from previously evaluated designs.In addition, NGE applies Graph Mutation with Uncertainty (GM-UC) by incorporating model uncertainty, which reduces the search space by balancing exploration and exploitation.We show that NGE significantly outperforms previous methods by an order of magnitude.As shown in experiments, NGE is the first algorithm that can automatically discover kinematically preferred robotic graph structures, such as a fish with two symmetrical flat side-fins and a tail, or a cheetah with athletic front and back legs.Instead of using thousands of cores for weeks, NGE efficiently solves searching problem within a day on a single 64 CPU-core Amazon EC2machine.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BkgWHnR5tm,Neural Graph Evolution: Towards Efficient Automatic Robot Design,Автоматический поиск конструкции роботов с помощью графовых нейронных сетей

"Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent structures in sequence modeling.Its goal is to use gates to control the information flow (e.g., whether to skip some information/transformation or not) in the recurrent computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal and is easy to overfit.In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the values of the gates towards 0 or 1.By doing so, we can (1) better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state; and (2) avoid overfitting to certain extent: the gates operate at their flat regions, which is shown to correspond to better generalization ability.However, learning towards discrete values of the gates is generally difficult.To tackle this challenge, we leverage the recently developed Gumbel-Softmax trick from the field of variational methods, and make the model trainable with standard backpropagation.Experimental results on language modeling and machine translation show that (1) the values of the gates generated by our method are more reasonable and intuitively interpretable, and (2) our proposed method generalizes better and achieves better accuracy on test sets in all tasks.Moreover, the learnt models are not sensitive to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation of the gate parameters due to the flat loss surface.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rJiaRbk0-,Towards Binary-Valued Gates for Robust LSTM Training ,"Мы предлагаем новый алгоритм для обучения LSTM путем обучения бинарно-значных ворот, который, как мы показали, обладает многими приятными свойствами."

"This paper investigates whether learning contingency-awareness and controllable aspects of an environment can lead to better exploration in reinforcement learning.To investigate this question, we consider an instantiation of this hypothesis evaluated on the Arcade Learning Element (ALE).In this study, we develop an attentive dynamics model (ADM) that discovers controllable elements of the observations, which are often associated with the location of the character in Atari games.The ADM is trained in a self-supervised fashion to predict the actions taken by the agent.The learned contingency information is used as a part of the state representation for exploration purposes.We demonstrate that combining actor-critic algorithm with count-based exploration using our representation achieves impressive results on a set of notoriously challenging Atari games due to sparse rewards.For example, we report a state-of-the-art score of >11,000 points on Montezuma's Revenge without using expert demonstrations, explicit high-level information (e.g., RAM states), or supervisory data.Our experiments confirm that contingency-awareness is indeed an extremely powerful concept for tackling exploration problems in reinforcement learning and opens up interesting research questions for further investigations.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyxGB2AcY7,Contingency-Aware Exploration in Reinforcement Learning,"Мы исследуем осознание непредвиденных обстоятельств и контролируемые аспекты в исследовании и достигли лучших результатов в игре ""Месть Монтесумы"" без демонстрации эксперта."

"Deep learning has become the state of the art approach in many machine learning problems such as classification.It has recently been shown that deep learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations.Taking the camera systems of self-driving cars as an example, small adversarial perturbations can cause the system to  make errors in important tasks, such as classifying traffic signs or detecting pedestrians.Hence, in order to use deep learning without safety concerns a proper defense strategy is required.We propose to use ensemble methods as a defense strategy against adversarial perturbations.We find that an attack leading one model to misclassify does not imply the same for other networks performing the same task.This makes ensemble methods an attractive defense strategy against adversarial attacks.We empirically show for the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 data sets that ensemble methods not only improve the accuracy of neural networks on test data but also increase their robustness against adversarial perturbations.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkA1f3NpZ,Ensemble Methods as a Defense to Adversarial Perturbations Against Deep Neural Networks,Использование ансамблевых методов в качестве защиты от враждебных возмущений против глубоких нейронных сетей.

Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique.Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim’s entire network architecture.  In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having only observed one forward propagation.Based on the extracted architecture attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in a transfer learning setting.From this meta-model,  we evaluate the importance of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process.Third, we propose and evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker’s observations.Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward understanding the DNNs’ vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],rk4Wf30qKQ,Security Analysis of Deep Neural Networks Operating in the Presence of Cache Side-Channel Attacks,"Мы проводим первый глубокий анализ безопасности атак на отпечатки пальцев ДНС, использующих побочные каналы кэша, что представляет собой шаг к пониманию уязвимости ДНС к атакам по побочным каналам."

Second, we introduce DeepRecon, an attack that reconstructs the architecture of the victim network by using the internal information extracted via Flush+Reload, a cache side-channel technique.Once the attacker observes function invocations that map directly to architecture attributes of the victim network, the attacker can reconstruct the victim’s entire network architecture.  In our evaluation, we demonstrate that an attacker can accurately reconstruct two complex networks (VGG19 and ResNet50) having only observed one forward propagation.Based on the extracted architecture attributes, we also demonstrate that an attacker can build a meta-model that accurately fingerprints the architecture and family of the pre-trained model in a transfer learning setting.From this meta-model,  we evaluate the importance of the observed attributes in the fingerprinting process.Third, we propose and evaluate new framework-level defense techniques that obfuscate our attacker’s observations.Our empirical security analysis represents a step toward understanding the DNNs’ vulnerability to cache side-channel attacks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],rk4Wf30qKQ,Security Analysis of Deep Neural Networks Operating in the Presence of Cache Side-Channel Attacks,"В данной работе проводятся атаки на побочные каналы кэша для извлечения атрибутов модели-жертвы и определения ее архитектуры, а также показано, что они могут достичь почти идеальной точности классификации."
"Learning with a primary objective, such as softmax cross entropy for classification and sequence generation, has been the norm for training deep neural networks for years.Although being a widely-adopted approach, using cross entropy as the primary objective exploits mostly the information from the ground-truth class for maximizing data likelihood, and largely ignores information from the complement (incorrect) classes.We argue that, in addition to the primary objective, training also using a complement objective that leverages information from the complement classes can be effective in improving model performance.This motivates us to study a new training paradigm that maximizes the likelihood of the ground-truth class while neutralizing the probabilities of the complement classes.We conduct extensive experiments on multiple tasks ranging from computer vision to natural language understanding.The experimental results confirm that, compared to the conventional training with just one primary objective, training also with the complement objective further improves the performance of the state-of-the-art models across all tasks.In addition to the accuracy improvement, we also show that models trained with both primary and complement objectives are more robust to single-step adversarial attacks.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyM7AiA5YX,Complement Objective Training,"Мы предлагаем обучение по дополнительным целям (COT), новую парадигму обучения, которая оптимизирует как основные, так и дополнительные цели для эффективного обучения параметров нейронных сетей."

"Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference.However, there has been limited progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how individual genetic factors cause major human diseases.In this work, we focus on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple causes?How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal relationships?To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling.For the first, we describe implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density.For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples.In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements.We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform the second best result by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SyELrEeAb,Implicit Causal Models for Genome-wide Association Studies,Применение неявных моделей к причинности и генетике

"Answering compositional questions requiring multi-step reasoning is challenging for current models.We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting questions, which is inspired by formal approaches to semantics.Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a knowledge graph, together with a vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning.Learned composition modules recursively combine constituents, culminating in a grounding for the complete sentence which is an answer to the question.For example, to interpret ‘not green’, the model will represent ‘green’ as a set of entities, ‘not’ as a trainable ungrounded vector, and then use this vector to parametrize a composition function to perform a complement operation.For each sentence, we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient descent.We show the model can learn to represent a variety of challenging semantic operators, such as quantifiers, negation, disjunctions and composed relations on a synthetic question answering task.The model also generalizes well to longer sentences than seen in its training data, in contrast to LSTM and RelNet baselines.We will release our code.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkaqxm-0b,Neural Compositional Denotational Semantics for Question Answering,"Мы описываем сквозную дифференцируемую модель для QA, которая учится представлять отрезки текста в вопросе в виде денотатов в графе знаний, изучая нейронные модули для композиции и синтаксическую структуру предложения."

"Reinforcement learning in environments with large state-action spaces is challenging, as exploration can be highly inefficient.Even if the dynamics are simple, the optimal policy can be combinatorially hard to discover.In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to structured exploration to improve the sample efficiency of on-policy exploration in large state-action spaces.The key idea is to model a stochastic policy as a hierarchical latent variable model, which can learn low-dimensional structure in the state-action space, and to define exploration by sampling from the low-dimensional latent space.This approach enables lower sample complexity, while preserving policy expressivity.In order to make learning tractable, we derive a joint learning and exploration strategy by combining hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning.The benefits of our learning approach are that1) it is principled,2) simple to implement,3) easily scalable to settings with many actions and4) easily composable with existing deep learning approaches.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on learning a deep centralized multi-agent policy, as multi-agent environments naturally have an exponentially large state-action space.In this setting, the latent hierarchy implements a form of multi-agent coordination during exploration and execution (MACE).We demonstrate empirically that MACE can more efficiently learn optimal policies in challenging multi-agent games with a large number (~20) of agents, compared to conventional baselines.Moreover, we show that our hierarchical structure leads to meaningful agent coordination.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyunpgbR-,Structured Exploration via Hierarchical Variational Policy Networks,Повышение эффективности глубокого обучения с подкреплением в больших пространствах состояний-действий с помощью структурированной разведки с глубокими иерархическими политиками.

"Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful paradigm for deriving complex behaviors from simple reward signals in a wide range of environments.When applying RL to continuous control agents in simulated physics environments, the body is usually considered to be part of the environment.However, during evolution the physical body of biological organisms and their controlling brains are co-evolved, thus exploring a much larger space of actuator/controller configurations.Put differently, the intelligence does not reside only in the agent's mind, but also in the design of their body.

"Syntax is a powerful abstraction for language understanding.Many downstream tasks require segmenting input text into meaningful constituent chunks (e.g., noun phrases or entities); more generally, models for learning semantic representations of text benefit from integrating syntax in the form of parse trees (e.g., tree-LSTMs).Supervised parsers have traditionally been used to obtain these trees, but lately interest has increased in unsupervised methods that induce syntactic representations directly from unlabeled text.To this end, we propose the deep inside-outside recursive autoencoder (DIORA), a fully-unsupervised method for discovering syntax that simultaneously learns representations for constituents within the induced tree.Unlike many prior approaches, DIORA does not rely on supervision from auxiliary downstream tasks and is thus not constrained to particular domains.Furthermore, competing approaches do not learn explicit phrase representations along with tree structures, which limits their applicability to phrase-based tasks.Extensive experiments on unsupervised parsing, segmentation, and phrase clustering demonstrate the efficacy of our method.DIORA achieves the state of the art in unsupervised parsing (46.9 F1) on the benchmark WSJ dataset.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJeq43AqF7,Unsupervised Latent Tree Induction with Deep Inside-Outside Recursive Auto-Encoders ,В этой работе мы предлагаем глубокие внутренние-внешние рекурсивные автокодировщики (DIORA) - полностью неконтролируемый метод обнаружения синтаксиса с одновременным обучением представлений для обнаруженных составляющих.

"Multi-task learning (MTL) with neural networks leverages commonalities in tasks to improve performance, but often suffers from task interference which reduces the benefits of transfer.To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm.A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks.A function block may be any neural network – for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer.Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached.In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input.We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks.We evaluate our model against cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets.Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence.In addition, routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch networks scale linearly with the number of tasks.On CIFAR100 (20 tasks) we obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% average reduction in training time.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],ry8dvM-R-,Routing Networks: Adaptive Selection of Non-Linear Functions for Multi-Task Learning,"маршрутизирующие сети: новый вид нейронных сетей, которые учатся адаптивно маршрутизировать свой вход для многозадачного обучения"

"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful tools for solving sequence-based problems, but their efficacy and execution time are dependent on the size of the network.

"Weight pruning has proven to be an effective method in reducing the model size and computation cost while not sacrificing the model accuracy.Conventional sparse matrix formats, however, involve irregular index structures with large storage requirement and sequential reconstruction process, resulting in inefficient use of highly parallel computing resources.Hence, pruning is usually restricted to inference with a batch size of one, for which an efficient parallel matrix-vector multiplication method exists.In this paper, a new class of sparse matrix representation utilizing Viterbi algorithm that has a high, and more importantly, fixed index compression ratio regardless of the pruning rate, is proposed.In this approach, numerous sparse matrix candidates are first generated by the Viterbi encoder, and then the one that aims to minimize the model accuracy degradation is selected by the Viterbi algorithm.The model pruning process based on the proposed Viterbi encoder and Viterbi algorithm is highly parallelizable, and can be implemented efficiently in hardware to achieve low-energy, high-performance index decoding process.Compared with the existing magnitude-based pruning methods, index data storage requirement can be further compressed by 85.2% in MNIST and 83.9% in AlexNet while achieving similar pruning rate.Even compared with the relative index compression technique, our method can still reduce the index storage requirement by 52.7% in MNIST and 35.5% in AlexNet.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],S1D8MPxA-,Viterbi-based Pruning for Sparse Matrix with Fixed and High Index Compression Ratio,Мы представляем новый метод обрезки и формат разреженной матрицы для обеспечения высокой степени сжатия индекса и параллельного процесса декодирования индекса.

"Many imaging tasks require global information about all pixels in an image.Conventional bottom-up classification networks globalize information by decreasing resolution; features are pooled and down-sampled into a single output.But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs.To globalize information while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable increase in network size and computational cost.This paper proposes stacked u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution scales while maintaining resolution.SUNets leverage the information globalization power of u-nets in a deeper net- work architectures that is capable of handling the complexity of natural images.SUNets perform extremely well on semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],BJgFcj0qKX,Stacked U-Nets: A No-Frills Approach to Natural Image Segmentation,"Представлена новая архитектура, которая использует возможности u-сетей по глобализации информации в более глубоких сетях и хорошо справляется с различными задачами без каких-либо наворотов."

"Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.  While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks.Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. We present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network.Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation.By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.  Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that applied to the popular VGG and ResNet architectures, our methods significantly reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers (about 65% space savings) while negligibly impacting accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],S16FPMgRZ,Tensor Contraction & Regression Networks,"Мы предлагаем тензорное сокращение и низкоранговые слои тензорной регрессии для сохранения и использования многолинейной структуры во всей сети, что приводит к огромной экономии пространства при минимальном влиянии на производительность."

"Do GANS (Generative Adversarial Nets) actually learn the target distribution?The foundational paper of Goodfellow et al.

"Within-class variation in a high-dimensional dataset can be modeled as being on a low-dimensional manifold due to the constraints of the physical processes producing that variation (e.g., translation, illumination, etc.).We desire a method for learning a representation of the manifolds induced by identity-preserving transformations that can be used to increase robustness, reduce the training burden, and encourage interpretability in machine learning tasks.In particular, what is needed is a representation of the transformation manifold that can robustly capture the shape of the manifold from the input data, generate new points on the manifold, and extend transformations outside of the training domain without significantly increasing the error.Previous work has proposed algorithms to efficiently learn analytic operators (called transport operators) that define the process of transporting one data point on a manifold to another.  The main contribution of this paper is to define two transfer learning methods that use this generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data.The first method uses this representation in a novel randomized approach to transfer learning that employs the learned generative model to map out unseen regions of the data space.These results are shown through demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification.The second method use of transport operators for injecting specific transformations into new data examples which allows for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks.However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train.Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times.Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time.We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues.UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs.We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks.In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete.Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyzdRiR9Y7,Universal Transformers,"Мы представляем универсальный трансформер - самоаттентивную параллельную во времени рекуррентную модель последовательности, которая превосходит трансформеры и LSTM в широком спектре задач преобразования последовательности в последовательность, включая машинный перевод."

"In the pursuit of increasingly intelligent learning systems, abstraction plays a vital role in enabling sophisticated decisions to be made in complex environments.The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of decisions.

"Deep learning has shown that learned functions can dramatically outperform hand-designed functions on perceptual tasks.Analogously, this suggests that learned update functions may similarly outperform current hand-designed optimizers, especially for specific tasks.However, learned optimizers are notoriously difficult to train and have yet to demonstrate wall-clock speedups over hand-designed optimizers, and thus are rarely used in practice.Typically, learned optimizers are trained by truncated backpropagation through an unrolled optimization process.The resulting gradients are either strongly biased (for short truncations) or have exploding norm (for long truncations).In this work we propose a training scheme which overcomes both of these difficulties, by dynamically weighting two unbiased gradient estimators for a variational loss on optimizer performance.This allows us to train neural networks to perform optimization faster than well tuned first-order methods.Moreover, by training the optimizer against validation loss, as opposed to training loss, we are able to use it to train models which generalize better than those trained by first order methods.We demonstrate these results on problems where our learned optimizer trains convolutional networks in a fifth of the wall-clock time compared to tuned first-order methods, and with an improvement","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJxwAo09KQ,Learned optimizers that outperform on wall-clock and validation loss,"Мы анализируем проблемы при обучении обучаемых оптимизаторов, решаем эти проблемы с помощью вариационной оптимизации с использованием двух взаимодополняющих оценок градиента и обучаем оптимизаторов, которые по времени в 5 раз быстрее, чем базовые оптимизаторы (например, Adam)."

"We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers.Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement.Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step.Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network.This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in SGD.No estimate of the Hessian is maintained.We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle.We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning.We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly-generated architectures.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],Sygx4305KQ,Small steps and giant leaps: Minimal Newton solvers for Deep Learning,"Быстрый решатель второго порядка для глубокого обучения, работающий на задачах масштаба ImageNet без настройки гиперпараметров"

"As neural networks grow deeper and wider, learning networks with hard-threshold activations is becoming increasingly important, both for network quantization, which can drastically reduce time and energy requirements, and for creating large integrated systems of deep networks, which may have non-differentiable components and must avoid vanishing and exploding gradients for effective learning.However, since gradient descent is not applicable to hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn them in a principled way.We address this problem by observing that setting targets for hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete optimization problem, and can be solved as such.The discrete optimization goal is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a linearly separable problem to solve.Given these targets, the network decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard convex approaches.Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly justified straight-through estimator as a special case.Empirically, we show that our algorithm improves classification accuracy in a number of settings, including for AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ImageNet, when compared to the straight-through estimator.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],B1Lc-Gb0Z,Deep Learning as a Mixed Convex-Combinatorial Optimization Problem,"Мы обучаем глубокие сети с жесткими порогами, задавая цели скрытых блоков с помощью комбинаторной оптимизации и веса с помощью выпуклой оптимизации, что приводит к улучшению производительности на ImageNet."

"Visual Active Tracking (VAT) aims at following a target object by autonomously controlling the motion system of a tracker given visual observations.Previous work has shown that the tracker can be trained in a simulator via reinforcement learning and deployed in real-world scenarios.However, during training, such a method requires manually specifying the moving path of the target object to be tracked, which cannot ensure the tracker’s generalization on the unseen object moving patterns.To learn a robust tracker for VAT, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial RL method which adopts an Asymmetric Dueling mechanism, referred to as AD-VAT.In AD-VAT, both the tracker and the target are approximated by end-to-end neural networks, and are trained via RL in a dueling/competitive manner: i.e., the tracker intends to lockup the target, while the target tries to escape from the tracker.They are asymmetric in that the target is aware of the tracker, but not vice versa.Specifically, besides its own observation, the target is fed with the tracker’s observation and action, and learns to predict the tracker’s reward as an auxiliary task.We show that such an asymmetric dueling mechanism produces a stronger target, which in turn induces a more robust tracker.To stabilize the training, we also propose a novel partial zero-sum reward for the tracker/target.The experimental results, in both 2D and 3D environments, demonstrate that the proposed method leads to a faster convergence in training and yields more robust tracking behaviors in different testing scenarios.For supplementary videos, see: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9rZj4Mea7wOZkdajK1TsprRg8iUf51BS The code is available at https://github.com/zfw1226/active_tracking_rl","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HkgYmhR9KX,AD-VAT: An Asymmetric Dueling mechanism for learning Visual Active Tracking,"Мы предлагаем AD-VAT, в котором следящий и целевой объект, рассматриваемые как два обучаемых агента, являются оппонентами и могут взаимно усиливаться в процессе обучения."

"The vast majority of natural sensory data is temporally redundant.For instance, video frames or audio samples which are sampled at nearby points in time tend to have similar values.  Typically, deep learning algorithms take no advantage of this redundancy to reduce computations.  This can be an obscene waste of energy.

"Unsupervised image-to-image translation has gained considerable attention due to the recent impressive progress based on generative adversarial networks (GANs).However, previous methods often fail in challenging cases, in particular, when an image has multiple target instances and a translation task involves significant changes in shape, e.g., translating pants to skirts in fashion images.To tackle the issues, we propose a novel method, coined instance-aware GAN (InstaGAN), that incorporates the instance information (e.g., object segmentation masks) and improves multi-instance transfiguration.The proposed method translates both an image and the corresponding set of instance attributes while maintaining the permutation invariance property of the instances.To this end, we introduce a context preserving loss that encourages the network to learn the identity function outside of target instances.We also propose a sequential mini-batch inference/training technique that handles multiple instances with a limited GPU memory and enhances the network to generalize better for multiple instances.Our comparative evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on different image datasets, in particular, in the aforementioned challenging cases.Code and results are available in https://github.com/sangwoomo/instagan","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],ryxwJhC9YX,InstaGAN: Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation,Мы предлагаем новый метод включения набора атрибутов экземпляра для перевода изображения в изображение.

"Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime  where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit.  While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit.  In this paper, we provide a new explanation.By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from  algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions.We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks trained on CIFAR10 and MNIST.As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems.This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than  the more conventional prior over parameter space.  If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets.

Empirically, we evaluate the learned Markov chain by showing that GMNs are able to discover orders among data instances and also perform comparably well to state-of-the-art methods on the one-shot recognition benchmark task.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],rJ695PxRW,Discovering Order in Unordered Datasets: Generative Markov Networks,В статье предлагаются генеративные сети Маркова - основанный на глубоком обучении подход к моделированию последовательностей и обнаружению порядка в массивах данных.

"Generative adversarial training can be generally understood as minimizing certain moment matching loss defined by a set of discriminator functions, typically  neural networks.The discriminator set should be large enough to be able to uniquely identify the true distribution (discriminative), and also be small enough to go beyond memorizing samples (generalizable).In this paper, we show that a discriminator set is guaranteed to be discriminative whenever its linear span is dense in the set of bounded continuous functions.This is a very mild condition satisfied even by neural networks with a single neuron.Further, we develop generalization bounds between the learned distribution and true distribution under different evaluation metrics.When evaluated with neural distance, our bounds show that generalization is guaranteed as long as the discriminator set is small enough, regardless of the size of the generator or hypothesis set.When evaluated with KL divergence, our bound provides an explanation on the counter-intuitive behaviors of testing likelihood in GAN training.Our analysis sheds lights on understanding the practical performance of GANs.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],Hk9Xc_lR-,On the Discrimination-Generalization Tradeoff in GANs,"В данной работе изучаются свойства дискриминации и обобщения GAN, когда набор дискриминаторов представляет собой ограниченный класс функций, как у нейронных сетей."

"Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult.In a such situation, learning a metric of a sequence from data is one possible solution.The previous study, SeqGAN, proposed the framework for unsupervised sequence generation, in which a metric is learned from data, and a generator is optimized with regard to the learned metric with policy gradient, inspired by generative adversarial nets (GANs) and reinforcement learning.In this paper, we make two proposals to learn better metric than SeqGAN's: partial reward function and expert-based reward function training.The partial reward function is a reward function for a partial sequence of a certain length.SeqGAN employs a reward function for completed sequence only.By combining long-scale and short-scale partial reward functions, we expect a learned metric to be able to evaluate a partial correctness as well as a coherence of a sequence, as a whole.In expert-based reward function training, a reward function is trained to discriminate between an expert (or true) sequence and a fake sequence that is produced by editing an expert sequence.Expert-based reward function training is not a kind of GAN frameworks.This makes the optimization of the generator easier.We examine the effect of the partial reward function and expert-based reward function training on synthetic data and real text data, and show improvements over SeqGAN and the model trained with MLE.Specifically, whereas SeqGAN gains 0.42 improvement of NLL over MLE on synthetic data, our best model gains 3.02 improvement, and whereas SeqGAN gains 0.029 improvement of BLEU over MLE, our best model gains 0.250 improvement.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],r1kP7vlRb,Toward learning better metrics for sequence generation training with policy gradient,"Данная работа направлена на изучение лучшей метрики для обучения без надзора, такого как генерация текста, и показывает значительное улучшение по сравнению с SeqGAN."
