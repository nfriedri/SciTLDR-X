"Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs.MPT is typically used in combination with a technique called loss scaling, that works by scaling up the loss value up before the start of backpropagation in order to minimize the impact of numerical underflow on training.Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages.We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter.We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods.We present experimental results on a variety of networks and tasks that show our approach can shorten the time to convergence and improve accuracy, compared with using the existing state-of-the-art MPT and single-precision floating point.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],rJlnfaNYvB,Adaptive Loss Scaling for Mixed Precision Training,﻿Nous concevons un échelonnement adaptatif des pertes pour améliorer l'apprentissage de la précision mixte qui surpasse les résultats de l'état de l'art.

"Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging due to their large size and complexity.Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models.However, these studies usually do not consider the changes in the loss function when performing quantization, nor do they take the different importances of DNN model parameters to the accuracy into account.We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each network parameter such that the increase in loss is minimized.The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each parameter and assigns it a precision accordingly.Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution.Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates.Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],SyOK1Sg0W,Adaptive Quantization of Neural Networks,Une méthode adaptative pour la quantification à point fixe des réseaux neuronaux basée sur une analyse théorique plutôt que sur des heuristiques.

"Universal probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) provide a powerful framework for specifying rich and complex probabilistic models.However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of substantially complicating the process of drawing inferences from the model.In particular, inference can become challenging when the support of the model varies between executions.Though general-purpose inference engines have been designed to operate in such settings, they are typically inefficient, often relying on proposing from the prior to make transitions.To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine (DCC).DCC divides the program into separate straight-line sub-programs, each of which has a fixed support allowing more powerful inference algorithms to be run locally, before recombining their outputs in a principled fashion.We show how DCC can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine, and empirically confirm that it can provide substantial performance improvements over previous approaches.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],Syx2tJnNtr,"Divide, Conquer, and Combine: a New Inference Strategy for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support","Diviser, Conquérir et Combiner est un nouveau schéma d'inférence qui peut être exécuté sur les programmes probabilistes à support stochastique, c'est-à-dire que l'existence même des variables est stochastique."
"Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a socialnetwork or a product purchase network) is an important task because the way anetwork functions is often determined by its communities.The traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based approaches,which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics thatseek to maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those betweenthem.Node embedding approaches, which represent each node in a graph as areal-valued vector, transform the problem of community detection in a graph tothat of clustering a set of vectors.Existing node embedding approaches are primarilybased on first initiating uniform random walks from each node to constructa context of a node and then seeks to make the vector representation ofthe node close to its context.However, standard node embedding approaches donot directly take into account the community structure of a network while constructingthe context around each node.To alleviate this, we explore two differentthreads of work.First, we investigate the use of biased random walks (specifically,maximum entropy based walks) to obtain more centrality preserving embeddingof nodes, which we hypothesize may lead to more effective clusters in the embeddedspace.Second, we propose a community structure aware node embeddingapproach where we incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics intothe objective function of node embedding.We demonstrate that our proposed approachfor community detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselinesas well as K-means on a standard node-embedded vector space (specifically,node2vec) on a wide range of real-life networks of different sizes and densities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1gQY64FwB,COMMUNITY PRESERVING NODE EMBEDDING,Un algorithme d'incorporation de nœuds préservant les communautés qui permet une détection plus efficace des communautés avec un regroupement sur l'espace incorporé.

This setting corresponds to that which human learners face as they acquire domain expertise, for example, as an individual reads a textbook chapter-by-chapter.Through simulations involving sequences of 10 related tasks, we find reason for optimism that nets will scale well as they advance from having a single skill to becoming domain experts.We observed two key phenomena.First, forward facilitation---the accelerated learning of task n+1 having learned n previous tasks---grows with n. Second, backward interference---the forgetting of the n previous tasks when learning task n+1---diminishes with n.  Forward facilitation is the goal of research on metalearning, and reduced backward interference is the goal of research on ameliorating catastrophic forgetting.We find that both of these goals are attained simply through broader exposure to a domain.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],Bygi-YNNC4,Scaling characteristics of sequential multitask learning: Networks naturally learn to learn,Nous étudions le comportement d'un CNN lorsqu'il maîtrise de nouvelles tâches tout en conservant la maîtrise des tâches apprises précédemment.

"The phase problem in diffraction physics is one of the oldest inverse problems in all of science.The central difficulty that any approach to solving this inverse problem must overcome is that half of the information, namely the phase of the diffracted beam, is always missing.In the context of electron microscopy, the phase problem is generally non-linear and solutions provided by phase-retrieval techniques are known to be poor approximations to the physics of electrons interacting with matter.Here, we show that a semi-supervised learning approach can effectively solve the phase problem in electron microscopy/scattering.In particular, we introduce a new Deep Neural Network (DNN), Y-net, which simultaneously learns a reconstruction algorithm via supervised training in addition to learning a physics-based regularization via unsupervised training.We demonstrate that this constrained, semi-supervised approach is an order of magnitude more data-efficient and accurate than the same model trained in a purely supervised fashion.In addition, the architecture of the Y-net model provides for a straightforward evaluation of the consistency of the model's prediction during inference and is generally applicable to the phase problem in other settings.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],Bygi2739Lr,Y-net: A Physics-constrained and Semi-supervised Learning Approach to the Phase Problem in Computational Electron Imaging,Nous introduisons un réseau de neurones profonds semi-supervisé pour approximer la solution du problème de phase en microscopie électronique.

"Most classification and segmentation datasets assume a closed-world scenario in which predictions are expressed as distribution over a predetermined set of visual classes.However, such assumption implies unavoidable and often unnoticeable failures in presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) input.These failures are bound to happen in most real-life applications since current visual ontologies are far from being comprehensive.We propose to address this issue by discriminative detection of OOD pixels in input data.Different from recent approaches, we avoid to bring any decisions by only observing the training dataset of the primary model trained to solve the desired computer vision task.Instead, we train a dedicated OOD modelwhich discriminates the primary training set from a much larger ""background"" dataset which approximates the variety of the visual world.We perform our experiments on high resolution natural images in a dense prediction setup.We use several road driving datasets as our training distribution, while we approximate the background distribution with the ILSVRC dataset.We evaluate our approach on WildDash test, which is currently the only public test dataset with out-of-distribution images.The obtained results show that the proposed approach succeeds to identify out-of-distribution pixels while outperforming previous work by a wide margin.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],H1x1noAqKX,Discriminative out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation,Nous présentons une nouvelle approche pour détecter les pixels hors distribution dans la segmentation sémantique.

"Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy, since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have different amounts of redundancy.The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN) directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead.To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs.However, prior works use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN, because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too large.The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results.It is difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) DDPG-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can achieve reasonable inference accuracy.In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for each activation layer.Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the inference latency by 54.06%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by 50.69%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygfnn4twS,AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ,"Quantification précise, rapide et automatisée d'un réseau neuronal à noyau avec une précision mixte à l'aide de l'apprentissage par renforcement profond hiérarchique."

"Through many recent advances in graph representation learning, performance achieved on tasks involving graph-structured data has substantially increased in recent years---mostly on tasks involving node-level predictions.The setup of prediction tasks over entire graphs (such as property prediction for a molecule, or side-effect prediction for a drug), however, proves to be more challenging, as the algorithm must combine evidence about several structurally relevant patches of the graph into a single prediction.Most prior work attempts to predict these graph-level properties while considering only one graph at a time---not allowing the learner to directly leverage structural similarities and motifs across graphs.Here we propose a setup in which a graph neural network receives pairs of graphs at once, and extend it with a co-attentional layer that allows node representations to easily exchange structural information across them.We first show that such a setup provides natural benefits on a pairwise graph classification task (drug-drug interaction prediction), and then expand to a more generic graph regression setup: enhancing predictions over QM9, a standard molecular prediction benchmark.Our setup is flexible, powerful and makes no assumptions about the underlying dataset properties, beyond anticipating the existence of multiple training graphs.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],BJeRykBKDH,Empowering Graph Representation Learning with Paired Training and Graph Co-Attention,Nous utilisons la co-attention des graphes dans un système de formation de graphes appariés pour la classification et la régression des graphes.

"We present Newtonian Monte Carlo (NMC), a method to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence by analyzing the first and second order gradients of the target density to determine a suitable proposal density at each point.Existing first order gradient-based methods suffer from the problem of determining an appropriate step size.Too small a step size and it will take a large number of steps to converge, while a very large step size will cause it to overshoot the high density region.NMC is similar to the Newton-Raphson update in optimization where the second order gradient is used to automatically scale the step size in each dimension.However, our objective is not to find a maxima but instead to find a parameterized density that can best match the local curvature of the target density.  This parameterized density is then used as a single-site Metropolis-Hastings proposal.As a further improvement on first order methods, we show that random variables with constrained supports don't need to be transformed before taking a gradient step.NMC directly matches constrained random variables to a proposal density with the same support thus keeping the curvature of the target density intact.We demonstrate the efficiency of NMC on a number of different domains.For statistical models where the prior is conjugate to the likelihood, our method recovers the posterior quite trivially in one step.However, we also show results on fairly large non-conjugate models, where NMC performs better than adaptive first order methods such as NUTS or other inexact scalable inference methods such as Stochastic Variational Inference or bootstrapping.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],SklKcJ3EFH,Newtonian Monte Carlo: a second-order gradient method for speeding up MCMC,Exploiter la courbure pour que les méthodes MCMC convergent plus rapidement que l'état de l'art.

"The 3D-zoom operation is the positive translation of the camera in the Z-axis, perpendicular to the image plane.In contrast, the optical zoom changes the focal length and the digital zoom is used to enlarge a certain region of an image to the original image size.In this paper, we are the first to formulate an unsupervised 3D-zoom learning problem where images with an arbitrary zoom factor can be generated from a given single image.An unsupervised framework is convenient, as it is a challenging task to obtain a 3D-zoom dataset of natural scenes due to the need for special equipment to ensure camera movement is restricted to the Z-axis.Besides, the objects in the scenes should not move when being captured, which hinders the construction of a large dataset of outdoor scenes.We present a novel unsupervised framework to learn how to generate arbitrarily 3D-zoomed versions of a single image, not requiring a 3D-zoom ground truth, called the Deep 3D-Zoom Net.The Deep 3D-Zoom Net incorporates the following features:(i) transfer learning from a pre-trained disparity estimation network via a back re-projection reconstruction loss;(ii) a fully convolutional network architecture that models depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), taking into account high-frequency details without the need for estimating the intermediate disparity; and(iii) incorporating a discriminator network that acts as a no-reference penalty for unnaturally rendered areas.Even though there is no baseline to fairly compare our results, our method outperforms previous novel view synthesis research in terms of realistic appearance on large camera baselines.We performed extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HylohJrKPS,Deep 3D-Zoom Net: Unsupervised Learning of Photo-Realistic 3D-Zoom,Une nouvelle architecture de réseau pour effectuer des zooms ou des gros plans en 3D profonde.

"The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions σ, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function f to any given approximation threshold ε, if and only if σ is non-polynomial.In this paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem.Furthermore we shall explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation.Specifically, if X in R^n is compact, then a neural network with n input units, m output units, and a single hidden layer with {n+d choose d} hidden units (independent of m and ε), can uniformly approximate any polynomial function f:X -> R^m whose total degree is at most d for each of its m coordinate functions.In the general case that f is any continuous function, we show there exists some N in O(ε^{-n}) (independent of m), such that N hidden units would suffice to approximate f.We also show that this uniform approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions imposed on the weights.We highlight several consequences:(i) For any δ > 0, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights w in the last layer to satisfy |w| < δ.(ii) There exists some λ>0 (depending only on f and σ), such that the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights w in the first layer to satisfy |w|>λ.(iii) If the non-bias weights in the first layer are *fixed* and randomly chosen from a suitable range, then the UAP holds with probability 1.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkevSgrtPr,A closer look at the approximation capabilities of neural networks,Un raffinement quantitatif du théorème d'approximation universelle via une approche algébrique.

"Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture.In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely  Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut.This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels.We solve it by introducing  edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search.Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability.Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.Our code has been made available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/on9lg3rpx1r6dkf/AABG5mt0sMHjnEJyoRnLEYW4a?dl=0.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJlS634tPr,PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search,Permettre la connexion partielle de canaux dans les super-réseaux pour régulariser et accélérer la recherche d'architectures différentiables

"Variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are approximate posterior inference algorithms that are often said to have complementary strengths, with VI being fast but biased and MCMC being slower but asymptotically unbiased.In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think.In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow.This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to too few warmup steps) may track that of VI (due to too few optimization steps), up to differences due to VI’s parameterization and asymptotic bias.Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and momentum-accelerated versions) do evolve similarly.This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it’s far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJggcy2NFS,Langevin Dynamics as Nonparametric Variational Inference,"Le comportement transitoire des algorithmes MCMC et d'inférence variationnelle basés sur le gradient est plus similaire qu'on pourrait le croire, ce qui remet en question l'affirmation selon laquelle l'inférence variationnelle est plus rapide que le MCMC."

"Image translation between two domains is a class of problems aiming to learn mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the target domain.It has been applied to numerous applications, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training.When paired training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed problem.We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term.We further notice that existing image translation techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce unwanted changes or artifacts to the input.Thus we propose to add an attention module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process.The module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes.The predicted attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection.Extensive experiments and evaluations show that our model while being simpler, achieves significantly better performance than existing image translation methods.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygypo0qtm,"Show, Attend and Translate: Unsupervised Image Translation with Self-Regularization and Attention",Nous proposons un modèle génératif simple pour la traduction non supervisée d'images et la détection de la saillance.
"Building deep neural networks to control autonomous agents which have to interact in real-time with the physical world, such as robots or automotive vehicles, requires a seamless integration of time into a network’s architecture.The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components.Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units.For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner.In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel.In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases.These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing.Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections.We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity.We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks.Additionally, we provide a toolbox to design, train, evaluate, and online-interact with layerwise-parallel networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],SkfNU2e0Z,Statestream: A toolbox to explore layerwise-parallel deep neural networks,"Nous définissons un concept de réseaux neuronaux profonds à modèles parallèles par couches, pour lesquels les couches fonctionnent en parallèle, et nous fournissons une boîte à outils pour concevoir, former, évaluer et interagir en ligne avec ces réseaux."

"Developing effective biologically plausible learning rules for deep neural networks is important for advancing connections between deep learning and neuroscience.To date, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks.In this work, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically motivated learning rules.Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding any biologically implausible weight transport.It can be shown mathematically that this approach has sufficient expressivity to approximate any online learning algorithm.Our experiments show that the meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures.Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that this model outperforms a state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning algorithm for continual learning on regression and classification benchmarks.This approach represents a step toward biologically plausible learning mechanisms that can not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HklfNQFL8H,Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity,Les réseaux qui apprennent avec des connexions de rétroaction et des règles de plasticité locale peuvent être optimisés en utilisant le méta-apprentissage.
"In the visual system, neurons respond to a patch of the input known as their classical receptive field (RF), and can be modulated by stimuli in the surround.These interactions are often mediated by lateral connections, giving rise to extra-classical RFs.We use supervised learning via backpropagation to learn feedforward connections, combined with an unsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between units within a convolutional neural network.These connections allow each unit to integrate information from its surround, generating extra-classical receptive fields for the units in our new proposed model (CNNEx).We demonstrate that these connections make the network more robust and achieve better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.Although the image statistics of MNIST and CIFAR-10 differ greatly, the same unsupervised learning rule generalized to both datasets.Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding the computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkxSEQtLUS,Convolutional neural networks with extra-classical receptive fields,Les CNN avec des connexions latérales d'inspiration biologique apprises de manière non supervisée sont plus robustes aux entrées bruyantes.

By drawing inspiration from this observation, we (a) reduce solution distance by starting with pretrained fp32 precision baseline networks and fine-tuning, and (b) combat noise introduced by quantizing weights and activations during training, by using larger batches along with matched learning rate annealing.

"Neural networks are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations.While existing literature largely focused on the vulnerability of learned models, we demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon that adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the input data distribution.Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarially trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution.We show this by constructing semantically- identical variants for MNIST and CIFAR10 respectively, and show that standardly trained models achieve similar clean accuracies on them, but adversarially trained models achieve significantly different robustness accuracies.This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves.Lastly, we discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],S1lFD4HnnE,On the Sensitivity of Adversarial Robustness to Input Data Distributions,"Les performances en matière de robustesse des modèles formés par PGD sont sensibles à la transformation des ensembles de données d'image préservant la sémantique, ce qui implique que l'évaluation des algorithmes d'apprentissage robuste est délicate en pratique."

"In recent years, the efficiency and even the feasibility of traditional load-balancing policies are challenged by the rapid growth of cloud infrastructure with increasing levels of server heterogeneity and increasing size of cloud services and applications.In such many software-load-balancers heterogeneous systems, traditional solutions, such as JSQ, incur an increasing communication overhead, whereas low-communication alternatives, such as JSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ scheme are either unstable or provide poor performance.We argue that a better low-communication load balancing scheme can be established by allowing each dispatcher to have a different view of the system and keep using JSQ, rather than greedily trying to avoid starvation on a per-decision basis. accordingly, we introduce the Loosely-Shortest -Queue family of load balancing algorithms.Roughly speaking, in Loosely-shortest -Queue, each dispatcher keeps a different approximation of the server queue lengths and routes jobs to the shortest among them.Communication is used only to update the approximations and make sure that they are not too far from the real queue lengths in expectation.We formally establish the strong stability of any Loosely-Shortest -Queue policy and provide an easy-to-verify sufficient condition for verifying that a policy is Loosely-Shortest -Queue.We further demonstrate that the Loosely-Shortest -Queue approach allows constructing throughput optimal policies with an arbitrarily low communication budget.Finally, using extensive simulations that consider homogeneous, heterogeneous and highly skewed heterogeneous systems in scenarios with a single dispatcher as well as with multiple dispatchers, we show that the examined Loosely-Shortest -Queue example policies are always stable as dictated by theory.Moreover, it exhibits an appealing performance and significantly outperforms well-known low-communication policies, such as JSQ(d) and JIQ, while using a similar communication budget.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],BJxN9Hvf-V,Load Balancing in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Systems with Multiple Dispatchers,"Solution d'équilibrage de charge évolutive et à faible communication pour les systèmes multi-dispatcheurs à serveurs hétérogènes, avec de solides garanties théoriques et des résultats empiriques prometteurs.

"Momentum based stochastic gradient methods such as heavy ball (HB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method are widely used in practice for training deep networks and other supervised learning models, as they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent (SGD).Rigorously speaking, fast gradient methods have provable improvements over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are exact.In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts, resulting in some practical gain.This work provides a counterpoint to this belief by proving that there exist simple problem instances where these methods cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters.These negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look like carefully constructed pathological instances.These results suggest (along with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a by-product of minibatching.Furthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which, on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and SGD's performance.This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based on a relatively less popular variant of Nesterov's Acceleration.Extensive empirical results in this paper show that ASGD has performance gains over HB, NAG, and SGD.The code for implementing the ASGD Algorithm can be found at https://github.com/rahulkidambi/AccSGD.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rJTutzbA-,On the insufficiency of existing momentum schemes for Stochastic Optimization,"Les schémas de momentum/accélération existants, tels que la méthode de la boule lourde et l'accélération de Nesterov, employés avec des gradients stochastiques, ne sont pas meilleurs que la descente de gradient stochastique vanille, en particulier lorsqu'ils sont employés avec des lots de petite taille."

"Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested.One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks.For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers.Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned.This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all?Is it important?Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance?If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence?In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers.(2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters.(3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification.(4) Pooling confers \emph{too much} deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to \emph{counteract} this inductive bias.Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions about the working of neural networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJeuOiRqKQ,Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs,Nous constatons que le pooling seul ne détermine pas la stabilité de la déformation dans les CNN et que la fluidité du filtre joue un rôle important dans la détermination de la stabilité.

"Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine learning research.The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional layers with respect to their information bandwidth.Recently, training `a priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low.However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks is unclear.In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of intra-layer topology.First, we derive a new sparse neural network initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse networks.Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy.To explain these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on.We then derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single topology that satisfies all of them.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJgCcCNtwH,NeuroFabric: Identifying Ideal Topologies for Training A Priori Sparse Networks,Nous étudions l'élagage des DNN avant la formation et apportons une réponse à la question de savoir quelle topologie doit être utilisée pour la formation de réseaux a priori épars.

"We propose to use a meta-learning objective that maximizes the speed of transfer on a modified distribution to learn how to modularize acquired knowledge.In particular, we focus on how to factor a joint distribution into appropriate conditionals, consistent with the causal directions.We explain when this can work, using the assumption that the changes in distributions are localized (e.g. to one of the marginals, for example due to an intervention on one of the variables).We prove that under this assumption of localized changes in causal mechanisms, the correct causal graph will tend to have only a few of its parameters with non-zero gradient, i.e. that need to be adapted (those of the modified variables).We argue and observe experimentally that this leads to faster adaptation, and use this property to define a meta-learning surrogate score which, in addition to a continuous parametrization of graphs, would favour correct causal graphs.Finally, motivated by the AI agent point of view (e.g. of a robot discovering its environment autonomously), we consider how the same objective can discover the causal variables themselves, as a transformation of observed low-level variables with no causal meaning.Experiments in the two-variable case validate the proposed ideas and theoretical results.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],ryxWIgBFPS,A Meta-Transfer Objective for Learning to Disentangle Causal Mechanisms,Cet article propose un objectif de méta-apprentissage basé sur la vitesse d'adaptation aux distributions de transfert pour découvrir une décomposition modulaire et des variables causales.

"We review eight machine learning classification algorithms to analyze Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in order to distinguish EEG patterns associated with five basic educational tasks.There is a large variety of classifiers being used in this EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) field.While previous EEG experiments used several classifiers in the same experiments or reviewed different algorithms on datasets from different experiments, our approach focuses on review eight classifier categories on the same dataset, including linear classifiers, non-linear Bayesian classifiers, nearest neighbour classifiers, ensemble methods, adaptive classifiers, tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning.Besides, we intend to find an approach which can run smoothly on the current mainstream personal computers and smartphones.  The empirical evaluation demonstrated that Random Forest and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform other approaches.We used a data set which users were conducting five frequently-conduct learning-related tasks, including reading, writing, and typing.Results showed that these best two algorithms could correctly classify different users with an accuracy increase of  5% to 9%, use each task independently.Within each subject, the tasks could be recognized with an accuracy increase of  4% to 7%, compared with other approaches.This work suggests that Random Forest could be a recommended approach (fast and accurate) for current mainstream hardware, while LSTM has the potential to be the first-choice approach when the mainstream computers and smartphones can process more data in a shorter time.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BkxmOn4FwH,Ensemble methods and LSTM outperformed other eight machine learning classifiers in an EEG-based BCI experiment,Deux algorithmes ont obtenu de meilleurs résultats que huit autres lors d'une expérience de BCI basée sur l'EEG.

"Adversarial examples are modified samples that preserve original image structures but deviate classifiers.Researchers have put efforts into developing methods for generating adversarial examples and finding out origins.Past research put much attention on decision boundary changes caused by these methods.This paper, in contrast, discusses the origin of adversarial examples from a more underlying knowledge representation point of view.Human beings can learn and classify prototypes as well as transformations of objects.While neural networks store learned knowledge in a more hybrid way of combining all prototypes and transformations as a whole distribution.Hybrid storage may lead to lower distances between different classes so that small modifications can mislead the classifier.A one-step distribution imitation method is designed to imitate distribution of the nearest different class neighbor.Experiments show that simply by imitating distributions from a training set without any knowledge of the classifier can still lead to obvious impacts on classification results from deep networks.It also implies that adversarial examples can be in more forms than small perturbations.Potential ways of alleviating adversarial examples are discussed from the representation point of view.The first path is to change the encoding of data sent to the training step.Training data that are more prototypical can help seize more robust and accurate structural knowledge.The second path requires constructing learning frameworks with improved representations.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BylRVjC9K7,Explaining Adversarial Examples with Knowledge Representation,Le stockage et la représentation hybrides des connaissances acquises peuvent être à l'origine d'exemples contradictoires.

"Efforts to reduce the numerical precision of computations in deep learning training have yielded systems that aggressively quantize weights and activations, yet employ wide high-precision accumulators for partial sums in inner-product operations to preserve the quality of convergence.The absence of any framework to analyze the precision requirements of partial sum accumulations results in conservative design choices.This imposes an upper-bound on the reduction of complexity of multiply-accumulate units.We present a statistical approach to analyze the impact of reduced accumulation precision on deep learning training.Observing that a bad choice for accumulation precision results in loss of information that manifests itself as a reduction in variance in an ensemble of partial sums, we derive a set of equations that relate this variance to the length of accumulation and the minimum number of bits needed for accumulation.We apply our analysis to three benchmark networks: CIFAR-10 ResNet 32, ImageNet ResNet 18 and ImageNet AlexNet.In each case, with accumulation precision set in accordance with our proposed equations, the networks successfully converge to the single precision floating-point baseline.We also show that reducing accumulation precision further degrades the quality of the trained network, proving that our equations produce tight bounds.Overall this analysis enables precise tailoring of computation hardware to the application, yielding area- and power-optimal systems.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BklMjsRqY7,Accumulation Bit-Width Scaling For Ultra-Low Precision Training Of Deep Networks,Nous présentons un cadre analytique pour déterminer les exigences en matière de largeur de bit d'accumulation dans les trois GEMM de formation à l'apprentissage profond et nous vérifions la validité et la rigueur de notre méthode par le biais d'expériences d'étalonnage.

"Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising avenue to enhance the performance of deep neural networks on a target domain, using labels only from a source domain.However, the two predominant methods, domain discrepancy reduction learning and semi-supervised learning, are not readily applicable when source and target domains do not share a common label space.This paper addresses the above scenario by learning a representation space that retains discriminative power on both the (labeled) source and (unlabeled) target domains while keeping representations for the two domains well-separated.Inspired by a theoretical analysis, we first reformulate the disjoint classification task, where the source and target domains correspond to non-overlapping class labels, to a verification one.To handle both within and cross domain verifications, we propose a Feature Transfer Network (FTN) to separate the target feature space from the original source space while aligned with a transformed source space.Moreover, we present a non-parametric multi-class entropy minimization loss to further boost the discriminative power of FTNs on the target domain.In experiments, we first illustrate how FTN works in a controlled setting of adapting from MNIST-M to MNIST with disjoint digit classes between the two domains and then demonstrate the effectiveness of FTNs through state-of-the-art performances on a cross-ethnicity face recognition problem.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BklhAj09K7,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Distance Metric Learning,Une nouvelle théorie d'adaptation non supervisée du domaine pour l'apprentissage métrique à distance et son application à la reconnaissance des visages à travers diverses variations ethniques.

"Hierarchical label structures widely exist in many machine learning tasks, ranging from those with explicit label hierarchies such as image classification to the ones that have latent label hierarchies such as semantic segmentation.Unfortunately, state-of-the-art methods often utilize cross-entropy loss which in-explicitly assumes the independence among class labels.Motivated by the fact that class members from the same hierarchy need to be similar to each others, we design a new training diagram called Hierarchical Complement Objective Training (HCOT).In HCOT, in addition to maximizing the probability of the ground truth class, we also neutralize the probabilities of rest of the classes in a hierarchical fashion, making the model take advantage of the label hierarchy explicitly.We conduct our method on both image classification and semantic segmentation.Results show that HCOT outperforms state-of-the-art models in CIFAR100, Imagenet, and PASCAL-context.Our experiments also demonstrate that HCOT can be applied on tasks with latent label hierarchies, which is a common characteristic in many machine learning tasks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],SyxQh3EFDr,Hierarchical Complement Objective Training,"Nous proposons l'entraînement hiérarchique par objectifs complémentaires, un nouveau paradigme d'entraînement pour exploiter efficacement la hiérarchie des catégories dans l'espace d'étiquetage pour la classification d'images et la segmentation sémantique."

"There is a growing interest in automated neural architecture search (NAS).To improve the efficiency of NAS, previous approaches adopt  weight sharing method to force all models share the same set of weights.  However, it has been observed that a model performing better with shared weights does not necessarily perform  better when trained alone.In this paper, we analyse existing weight sharing one-shot NAS approaches from a Bayesian point of view and identify the posterior fading problem, which compromises the effectiveness of shared weights.To alleviate this problem, we present a practical approach to guide the parameter posterior towards its true distribution.Moreover, a hard latency constraint is introduced during the search so that the desired latency can be achieved.The resulted method, namely Posterior Convergent NAS (PC-NAS), achieves state-of-the-art performance under standard GPU latency constraint on ImageNet.In our small search space, our model PC-NAS-S attains76.8% top-1 accuracy, 2.1% higher than MobileNetV2 (1.4x) with the same latency.When adopted to our large search space, PC-NAS-L achieves 78.1% top-1 accuracy within 11ms.The discovered architecture also transfers well to other computer vision applications such as object detection and person re-identification.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJgJNCEKPr,Improving One-Shot NAS By Suppressing The Posterior Fading,"Notre article identifie le problème de l'approche existante de partage de poids dans la recherche d'architecture neuronale et propose une méthode pratique, qui donne de bons résultats."

"Model-based reinforcement learning has been empirically demonstrated as a successful strategy to improve sample efficiency.Particularly, Dyna architecture, as an elegant model-based architecture integrating learning and planning, provides huge flexibility of using a model.One of the most important components in Dyna is called search-control, which refers to the process of generating state or state-action pairs from which we query the model to acquire simulated experiences.Search-control is critical to improve learning efficiency.In this work, we propose a simple and novel search-control strategy by searching high frequency region on value function.Our main intuition is built on Shannon sampling theorem from signal processing, which indicates that a high frequency signal requires more samples to reconstruct.We empirically show that a high frequency function is more difficult to approximate.This suggests a search-control strategy: we should use states in high frequency region of the value function to query the model to acquire more samples.We develop a simple strategy to locally measure the frequency of a function by gradient norm, and provide theoretical justification for this approach.We then apply our strategy to search-control in Dyna, and conduct experiments to show its property and effectiveness on benchmark domains.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],B1gskyStwr,Frequency-based Search-control in Dyna,Acquérir des états de la région haute fréquence pour le contrôle de la recherche dans Dyna.

"Knowledge bases, massive collections of facts (RDF triples) on diverse topics, support vital modern applications.However, existing knowledge bases contain very little data compared to the wealth of information on the Web.This is because the industry standard in knowledge base creation and augmentation suffers from a serious bottleneck: they rely on domain experts to identify appropriate web sources to extract data from.Efforts to fully automate knowledge extraction have failed to improve this standard: these automated systems are able to retrieve much more data and from a broader range of sources, but they suffer from very low precision and recall.As a result, these large-scale extractions remain unexploited.In this paper, we present MIDAS, a system that harnesses the results of automated knowledge extraction pipelines to repair the bottleneck in industrial knowledge creation and augmentation processes.MIDAS automates the suggestion of good-quality web sources and describes what to extract with respect to augmenting an existing knowledge base.We make three major contributions.First, we introduce a novel concept, web source slices, to describe the contents of a web source.Second, we define a profit function to quantify the value of a web source slice with respect to augmenting an existing knowledge base.Third, we develop effective and highly-scalable algorithms to derive high-profit web source slices.We demonstrate that MIDAS produces high-profit results and outperforms the baselines significantly on both real-word and synthetic datasets.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BketCg9p6X,MIDAS: Finding the Right Web Sources to Fill Knowledge Gaps,Cet article se concentre sur l'identification de sources web de haute qualité pour le pipeline d'augmentation des bases de connaissances industrielles.
"We explore the match prediction problem where one seeks to estimate the likelihood of a group of M items preferred over another, based on partial group comparison data.Challenges arise in practice.As existing state-of-the-art algorithms are tailored to certain statistical models, we have different best algorithms across distinct scenarios.Worse yet, we have no prior knowledge on the underlying model for a given scenario.These call for a unified approach that can be universally applied to a wide range of scenarios and achieve consistently high performances.To this end, we incorporate deep learning architectures so as to reflect the key structural features that most state-of-the-art algorithms, some of which are optimal in certain settings, share in common.This enables us to infer hidden models underlying a given dataset, which govern in-group interactions and statistical patterns of comparisons, and hence to devise the best algorithm tailored to the dataset at hand.Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we evaluate our framework in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.It turns out that our framework consistently leads to the best performance across all datasets in terms of cross entropy loss and prediction accuracy, while the state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from inconsistent performances across different datasets.Furthermore, we show that it can be easily extended to attain satisfactory performances in rank aggregation tasks, suggesting that it can be adaptable for other tasks as well.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJxYUaVtPB,Match prediction from group comparison data using neural networks,"Nous étudions les mérites de l'utilisation de réseaux neuronaux dans le problème de prédiction de correspondance où l'on cherche à estimer la probabilité qu'un groupe de M articles soit préféré à un autre, sur la base de données partielles de comparaison de groupes."

"Generative deep learning has sparked a new wave of Super-Resolution (SR) algorithms that enhance single images with impressive aesthetic results, albeit with imaginary details.Multi-frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) offers a more grounded approach to the ill-posed problem, by conditioning on multiple low-resolution views.This is important for satellite monitoring of human impact on the planet -- from deforestation, to human rights violations -- that depend on reliable imagery.To this end, we present HighRes-net, the first deep learning approach to MFSR that learns its sub-tasks in an end-to-end fashion:(i) co-registration,(ii) fusion,(iii) up-sampling, and(iv) registration-at-the-loss.Co-registration of low-res views is learned implicitly through a reference-frame channel, with no explicit registration mechanism.We learn a global fusion operator that is applied recursively on an arbitrary number of low-res pairs.We introduce a registered loss, by learning to align the SR output to a ground-truth through ShiftNet.We show that by learning deep representations of multiple views, we can super-resolve low-resolution signals and enhance Earth observation data at scale.Our approach recently topped the European Space Agency's MFSR competition on real-world satellite imagery.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJxJ2h4tPr,HighRes-net: Multi-Frame Super-Resolution by Recursive Fusion,"La première approche d'apprentissage profond de la MFSR pour résoudre l'enregistrement, la fusion et le suréchantillonnage de bout en bout."

"Large mini-batch parallel SGD is commonly used for distributed training of deep networks.Approaches that use tightly-coupled exact distributed averaging based on AllReduce are sensitive to slow nodes and high-latency communication.In this work we show the applicability of Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) for distributed training.SGP uses a gossip algorithm called PushSum for approximate distributed averaging, allowing for much more loosely coupled communications which can be beneficial in high-latency or high-variability scenarios.The tradeoff is that approximate distributed averaging injects additional noise in the gradient which can affect the train and test accuracies.We prove that SGP converges to a stationary point of smooth, non-convex objective functions.Furthermore, we validate empirically the potential of SGP.For example, using 32 nodes with 8 GPUs per node to train ResNet-50 on ImageNet, where nodes communicate over 10Gbps Ethernet, SGP completes 90 epochs in around 1.5 hours while AllReduce SGD takes over 5 hours, and the top-1 validation accuracy of SGP remains within 1.2% of that obtained using AllReduce SGD.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HkgSk2A9Y7,Stochastic Gradient Push for Distributed Deep Learning,"Pour la formation distribuée sur des réseaux à forte latence, utilisez le calcul approximatif de la moyenne distribuée basé sur les commérages au lieu du calcul exact de la moyenne distribuée comme AllReduce."

"Training conditional generative latent-variable models is challenging in scenarios where the conditioning signal is very strong and the decoder is expressive enough to generate a plausible output given only the condition; the generative model tends to ignore the latent variable, suffering from posterior collapse. We find, and empirically show, that one of the major reasons behind posterior collapse is rooted in the way that generative models are conditioned, i.e., through concatenation of the latent variable and the condition. To mitigate this problem, we propose to explicitly make the latent variables depend on the condition by unifying the conditioning and latent variable sampling, thus coupling them so as to prevent the model from discarding the root of variations. To achieve this, we develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution not only of the latent variables, but also of the condition, the latter acting as prior on the former.

"Pruning is a popular technique for compressing a neural network: a large pre-trained network is fine-tuned while connections are successively removed.However, the value of pruning has largely evaded scrutiny.In this extended abstract, we examine residual networks obtained through Fisher-pruning and make two interesting observations.First, when time-constrained, it is better to train a simple, smaller network from scratch than prune a large network.Second, it is the architectures obtained through the pruning process  --- not the learnt weights --- that prove valuable.Such architectures are powerful when trained from scratch.Furthermore, these architectures are easy to approximate without any further pruning: we can prune once and obtain a family of new, scalable network architectures for different memory requirements.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],r1lbgwFj5m,Pruning neural networks: is it time to nip it in the bud?,"La formation de petits réseaux est plus efficace que l'élagage, mais l'élagage permet de former de bons petits réseaux qui sont faciles à copier."
"Supervised learning problems---particularly those involving social data---are often subjective.That is, human readers, looking at the same data, might come to legitimate but completely different conclusions based on their personal experiences.Yet in machine learning settings feedback from multiple human annotators is often reduced to a single ``ground truth'' label, thus hiding the true, potentially rich and diverse interpretations of the data found across the social spectrum.We explore the rewards and challenges of discovering and learning representative distributions of the labeling opinions of a large human population.A major, critical cost to this approach is the number of humans needed to provide enough labels not only to obtain representative samples but also to train a machine to predict representative distributions on unlabeled data.We propose aggregating label distributions over, not just individuals, but also data items, in order to maximize the costs of humans in the loop.We test different aggregation approaches on state-of-the-art deep learning models.Our results suggest that careful label aggregation methods can greatly reduce the number of samples needed to obtain representative distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],HJlsixKqyQ,Aggregating Crowdsourced Labels in Subjective Domains,Nous étudions le problème de l'apprentissage de la prédiction de la diversité sous-jacente des croyances présentes dans les domaines d'apprentissage supervisé.

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a family of generative models that do not minimize a single training criterion.Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost.GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players’ parameters.One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium.Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence.We show that this view is overly restrictive.During GAN training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful.We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization.Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail.We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful.This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],ByQpn1ZA-,Many Paths to Equilibrium: GANs Do Not Need to Decrease a Divergence At Every Step,Nous trouvons des preuves que la minimisation de la divergence peut ne pas être une caractérisation précise de l'entraînement des GAN.

"Conventional deep reinforcement learning typically determines an appropriate primitive action at each timestep, which requires enormous amount of time and effort for learning an effective policy, especially in large and complex environments.To deal with the issue fundamentally, we incorporate macro actions, defined as sequences of primitive actions, into the primitive action space to form an augmented action space.The problem lies in how to find an appropriate macro action to augment the primitive action space.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are difficult to train on sequence processing tasks, not only because input noise may be amplified through feedback, but also because any inaccuracy in the weights has similar consequences as input noise.We describe a method for denoising the hidden state during training to achieve more robust representations thereby improving generalization performance.Attractor dynamics are incorporated into the hidden state to `clean up' representations at each step of a sequence.The attractor dynamics are trained through an auxillary denoising loss to recover previously experienced hidden states from noisy versions of those states.This state-denoised recurrent neural network (SDRNN) performs multiple steps of internal processing for each external sequence step.On a range of tasks, we show that the SDRNN outperforms a generic RNN as well as a variant of the SDRNN with attractor dynamics on the hidden state but without the auxillary loss.We argue that attractor dynamics---and corresponding connectivity constraints---are an essential component of the deep learning arsenal and should be invoked not only for recurrent networks but also for improving deep feedforward nets and intertask transfer.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJgyAoRqFQ,State-Denoised Recurrent Neural Networks,Nous proposons un mécanisme de débruitage de l'état interne d'un RNN pour améliorer les performances de généralisation.

"The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn from the surrounding context.Lexical features are fed into the first layer and propagated through a deep network of hidden layers.We argue that the need to represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model’s capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states.We show that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements on standard WMT translation tasks and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the hidden layers.We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments exploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SJgfQH6PQ4,Addressing the Representation Bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation with Lexical Shortcuts,Le fait de doter le modèle de transformation de raccourcis vers la couche d'intégration libère la capacité du modèle pour l'apprentissage de nouvelles informations.

Our experimental results show thatNormCo outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on two disease normalization corpora in terms of (1) prediction quality and (2) efficiency, and is at least as performant in terms of accuracy and F1 score on tagged documents.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJerQWcp6Q,NormCo: Deep Disease Normalization for Biomedical Knowledge Base Construction,"Utilise un autoencodeur GRU pour représenter le ""contexte"" (entités liées à une maladie donnée dans le cadre d'une phrase), résolvant la tâche BioNLP avec des améliorations significatives par rapport aux méthodes les plus connues."

"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples.In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear.Here we show that distributions of logit differences have a universal functional form.This functional form is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; nor does it change during training.This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation.We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD).Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness.Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity.To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10.Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rk6H0ZbRb,Intriguing Properties of Adversarial Examples,"L'erreur de l'adversaire a une forme de loi de puissance similaire pour tous les ensembles de données et modèles étudiés, et l'architecture a son importance."

"In this paper, we find that by designing a novel loss function entitled, ''tracking loss'', Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detectors can be successfully converted to well-performed visual trackers without any extra computational cost.This property is preferable to visual tracking where annotated video sequences for training are always absent, because rich features learned by detectors from still images could be utilized by dynamic trackers.It also avoids extra machinery such as feature engineering and feature aggregation proposed in previous studies.Tracking loss achieves this property by exploiting the internal structure of feature maps within the detection network and treating different feature points discriminatively.Such structure allows us to simultaneously consider discrimination quality and bounding box accuracy which is found to be crucial to the success.We also propose a network compression method to accelerate tracking speed without performance reduction.That also verifies tracking loss will remain highly effective even if the network is drastically compressed.Furthermore, if we employ a carefully designed tracking loss ensemble, the tracker would be much more robust and accurate.Evaluation results show that our trackers (including the ensemble tracker and two baseline trackers), outperform all state-of-the-art methods on VOT 2016 Challenge in terms of Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and robustness.We will make the code publicly available.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1lzcXfknm,Tracking Loss: Converting Object Detector to Robust Visual Tracker,Nous avons réussi à convertir un détecteur populaire RPN en un tracker performant du point de vue de la fonction de perte.

"With the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, our cyberspace is nowadays dominated by billions of low-cost computing nodes, which expose an unprecedented heterogeneity to our computing systems.Dynamic analysis, one of the most effective approaches to finding software bugs, has become paralyzed due to the lack of a generic emulator capable of running diverse previously-unseen firmware.In recent years, we have witnessed devastating security breaches targeting IoT devices.These security concerns have significantly hamstrung further evolution of IoT technology.In this work, we present Laelaps, a device emulator specifically designed to run diverse software on low-cost IoT devices.We do not encode into our emulator any specific information about a device.Instead, Laelaps infers the expected behavior of firmware via symbolic-execution-assisted peripheral emulation and generates proper inputs to steer concrete execution on the fly.This unique design feature makes Laelaps the first generic device emulator capable of running diverse firmware with no a priori knowledge about the target device.To demonstrate the capabilities of Laelaps, we deployed two popular dynamic analysis techniques---fuzzing testing and dynamic symbolic execution---on top of our emulator.We successfully identified both self-injected and real-world vulnerabilities.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rylaZ6iIDr,Device-agnostic Firmware Execution is Possible,Exécution du micrologiciel en fonction du dispositif

"Models of code can learn distributed representations of a program's syntax and semantics to predict many non-trivial properties of a program.Recent state-of-the-art models leverage highly structured representations of programs, such as trees, graphs and paths therein (e.g. data-flow relations), which are precise and abundantly available for code.This provides a strong inductive bias towards semantically meaningful relations, yielding more generalizable representations than classical sequence-based models.Unfortunately, these models primarily rely on graph-based message passing to represent relations in code, which makes them de facto local due to the high cost of message-passing steps, quite in contrast to modern, global sequence-based models, such as the Transformer.In this work, we bridge this divide between global and structured models by introducing two new hybrid model families that are both global and incorporate structural bias: Graph Sandwiches, which wrap traditional (gated) graph message-passing layers in sequential message-passing layers; and Graph Relational Embedding Attention Transformers (GREAT for short), which bias traditional Transformers with relational information from graph edge types.By studying a popular, non-trivial program repair task, variable-misuse identification, we explore the relative merits of traditional and hybrid model families for code representation.Starting with a  graph-based model that already improves upon the prior state-of-the-art for this task by 20%, we show that our proposed hybrid models improve an additional 10-15%, while training both faster and using fewer parameters.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],B1lnbRNtwr,Global Relational Models of Source Code,Les modèles de code source qui combinent des caractéristiques globales et structurelles apprennent des représentations plus puissantes des programmes.

"Importance sampling (IS) is a standard Monte Carlo (MC) tool to compute information about random variables such as moments or quantiles with unknown distributions.  IS is asymptotically consistent as the number of MC samples, and hence deltas (particles) that parameterize the density estimate, go to infinity.However, retaining infinitely many particles is intractable.We propose a scheme for only keeping a \emph{finite representative subset} of particles and their augmented importance weights that is \emph{nearly consistent}. To do so in {an online manner}, we approximate importance sampling in two ways.  First, we replace the deltas by kernels, yielding kernel density estimates (KDEs).  Second, we sequentially project KDEs onto nearby lower-dimensional subspaces.We characterize the asymptotic bias of this scheme as determined by a compression parameter and kernel bandwidth, which yields a tunable tradeoff between consistency and memory.In experiments,  we observe a favorable tradeoff between memory and accuracy, providing for the first time near-consistent compressions of arbitrary posterior distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1lSFJ34FH, A Projection Operator to Balance Consistency and Complexity in Importance Sampling,Nous avons proposé un nouvel algorithme d'échantillonnage par importance compressé à noyau.

"Recent advances in deep learning techniques has shown the usefulness of the deep neural networks in extracting features required to perform the task at hand.However, these features learnt are in particular helpful only for the initial task.This is due to the fact that the features learnt are very task specific and does not capture the most general and task agnostic features of the input.In fact the way humans are seen to learn is by disentangling features which task agnostic.This indicates that leaning task agnostic features by disentangling only the most informative features from the input data.Recently Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have shown to be the de-facto models to capture the latent variables in a generative sense.As these latent features can be represented as continuous and/or discrete variables, this indicates us to use VAE with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables for the latent space.We achieve this by performing our experiments using a modified version of joint-vae to learn the disentangled features.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],r1gFDS8aHB,Neural Disentanglement using Mixture Latent Space with Continuous and Discrete Variables,Modèle de mélange pour le désenchevêtrement neuronal
"To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process.The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task.However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions.In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression.In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions.Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions.We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations.Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting.Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SkeZisA5t7,Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks,Nous avons développé des estimations robustes de l'information mutuelle pour les DNN et les avons utilisées pour observer la compression dans les réseaux avec des fonctions d'activation non saturantes.

"We investigate the robustness properties of image recognition models equipped with two features inspired by human vision, an explicit episodic memory and a shape bias, at the ImageNet scale.As reported in previous work, we show that an explicit episodic memory improves the robustness of image recognition models against small-norm adversarial perturbations under some threat models.It does not, however, improve the robustness against more natural, and typically larger, perturbations.Learning more robust features during training appears to be necessary for robustness in this second sense.We show that features derived from a model that was encouraged to learn global, shape-based representations (Geirhos et al., 2019) do not only improve the robustness against natural perturbations, but when used in conjunction with an episodic memory, they also provide additional robustness against adversarial perturbations.Finally, we address three important design choices for the episodic memory: memory size, dimensionality of the memories and the retrieval method.We show that to make the episodic memory more compact, it is preferable to reduce the number of memories by clustering them, instead of reducing their dimensionality.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HylYtaVtwS,Improving the robustness of ImageNet classifiers using elements of human visual cognition,"étude systématique des modèles de reconnaissance d'images à grande échelle basés sur le cache, en se concentrant particulièrement sur leurs propriétés de robustesse"

"Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) can be used to improve classical CNNs by equipping them with the geometric structure of groups.Central in the success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory.Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory).In this paper we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups.In our approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra.This leads to a flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline expansions.The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCam dataset) in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset) in which scale equivariance is important.In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1gBhkBFDH,B-Spline CNNs on Lie groups,L'article décrit un cadre flexible pour construire des CNN qui sont équivoques pour une grande classe de groupes de transformations.

"We present a technique to improve the generalization of deep representations learned on small labeled datasets by introducing self-supervised tasks as auxiliary loss functions.Although recent research has shown benefits of self-supervised learning (SSL) on large unlabeled datasets, its utility on small datasets is unknown.We find that SSL reduces the relative error rate of few-shot meta-learners by 4%-27%, even when the datasets are small and only utilizing images within the datasets.The improvements are greater when the training set is smaller or the task is more challenging.Though the benefits of SSL may increase with larger training sets, we observe that SSL can have a negative impact on performance when there is a domain shift between distribution of images used for meta-learning and SSL.Based on this analysis we present a technique that automatically select images for SSL from a large, generic pool of unlabeled images for a given dataset using a domain classifier that provides further improvements.We present results using several meta-learners and self-supervised tasks across datasets with varying degrees of domain shifts and label sizes to characterize the effectiveness of SSL for few-shot learning.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HkenPn4KPH,When Does Self-supervision Improve Few-shot Learning?,L'autosupervision permet d'améliorer la reconnaissance de quelques clichés sur des ensembles de données de petite taille et difficiles sans recourir à des données supplémentaires.

"Now GANs can generate more and more realistic face images that can easily fool human beings.

"The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community.Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes.The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling, and most recently in reinforcement learning.In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients.The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third.We provide empirical evidence suggesting this is a serious issue in practice.Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cramér distance.We show that the Cramér distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences.We give empirical results on a number of domains comparing these three divergences.To illustrate the practical relevance of the Cramér distance we design a new algorithm, the Cramér Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it has a number of desirable properties over the related Wasserstein GAN.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],S1m6h21Cb,The Cramer Distance as a Solution to Biased Wasserstein Gradients,"La distance de Wasserstein est difficile à minimiser avec la descente de gradient stochastique, alors que la distance de Cramer peut être optimisée facilement et fonctionne tout aussi bien."

"Lifelong learning is the problem of learning multiple consecutive tasks in a sequential manner where knowledge gained from previous tasks is retained and used for future learning.It is essential towards the development of intelligent machines that can adapt to their surroundings.In this work we focus on a lifelong learning approach to generative modeling where we continuously incorporate newly observed streaming distributions into our learnt model.We do so through a student-teacher architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far without the need to retain the past data nor the past models.Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, the student model leverages the information learnt by the teacher, which acts as a summary of everything seen till now.The regularizer has the additional benefit of reducing the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over streaming data.We demonstrate its efficacy on streaming distributions as well as its ability to learn a common latent representation across a complex transfer learning scenario.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],S1fduCl0b,Lifelong Generative Modeling,Apprentissage distributionnel permanent grâce à une architecture élève-enseignant couplée à un régularisateur postérieur à modèle croisé.

"We introduce dynamic instance hardness (DIH) to facilitate the training of machine learning models.DIH is a property of each training sample and is computed as the running mean of the sample's instantaneous hardness as measured over the training history.We use DIH to evaluate how well a model retains knowledge about each training sample over time.We find that for deep neural nets (DNNs), the DIH of a sample in relatively early training stages reflects its DIH in later stages and as a result, DIH can be effectively used to reduce the set of training samples in future epochs.Specifically, during each epoch, only samples with high DIH are trained (since they are historically hard) while samples with low DIH can be safely ignored.DIH is updated each epoch only for the selected samples, so it does not require additional computation.Hence, using DIH during training leads to an appreciable speedup.Also, since the model is focused on the historically more challenging samples, resultant models are more accurate.The above, when formulated as an algorithm, can be seen as a form of curriculum learning, so we call our framework DIH curriculum learning (or DIHCL).The advantages of DIHCL, compared to other curriculum learning approaches, are: (1) DIHCL does not require additional inference steps over the data not selected by DIHCL in each epoch, (2) the dynamic instance hardness, compared to static instance hardness (e.g., instantaneous loss), is more stable as it integrates information over the entire training history up to the present time.Making certain mathematical assumptions, we formulate the problem of DIHCL as finding a curriculum that maximizes a multi-set function $f(\cdot)$, and derive an approximation bound for a DIH-produced curriculum relative to the optimal curriculum.Empirically, DIHCL-trained DNNs significantly outperform random mini-batch SGD and other recently developed curriculum learning methods in terms of efficiency, early-stage convergence, and final performance, and this is shown in training several state-of-the-art DNNs on 11 modern datasets.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1lXVJStwB,Dynamic Instance Hardness,Une nouvelle compréhension de la dynamique de l'apprentissage et des mesures de la difficulté de mémorisation permettent un apprentissage efficace et prouvable des programmes.

"When training a deep neural network for supervised image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification of class Y. Following the notation of Gong et al. (2016), we can divide features broadly into the classes of(i) “core” or “conditionally invariant” features X^ci whose distribution P(X^ci | Y) does not change substantially across domains and(ii) “style” or “orthogonal” features X^orth whose distribution P(X^orth | Y) can change substantially across domains.These latter orthogonal features would generally include features such as position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color or posture for images of persons.We try to guard against future adversarial domain shifts by ideally just using the “conditionally invariant” features for classification.In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable.We can hence not directly see the distributional change of features across different domains. We do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable.We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person.In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image.The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.We provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al. (2016).However, we are interested in settings where we cannot observe the domain directly and we treat domain as a latent variable.If two or more samples share the same class and identifier, (Y, ID)=(y,i), then we treat those samples as counterfactuals under different style interventions on the orthogonal or style features.Using this grouping-by-ID approach, we regularize the network to provide near constant output across samples that share the same ID by penalizing with an appropriate graph Laplacian.This is shown to substantially improve performance in settings where domains change in terms of image quality, brightness, color changes, and more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness and transfer learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HyPpD0g0Z,Grouping-By-ID: Guarding Against Adversarial Domain Shifts,"Nous proposons une régularisation contrefactuelle pour se prémunir contre les changements de domaine adverses résultant de changements dans la distribution des ""caractéristiques de style"" latentes des images."

"Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms require several steps of gradient descent to adapt to newly incoming tasks.This process becomes more costly as the number  of  samples  increases.

"An important research direction in machine learning has centered around developing meta-learning algorithms to tackle few-shot learning.An especially successful algorithm has been Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a method that consists of two optimization loops, with the outer loop finding a meta-initialization, from which the inner loop can efficiently learn new tasks.Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse,  with the meta initialization already containing high quality features?We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor.This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of the underlying neural network.ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML.We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm).We conclude with a discussion of the rapid learning vs feature reuse question for meta-learning algorithms more broadly.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkgMkCEtPB,Rapid Learning or Feature Reuse?

"Machine learning models for question-answering (QA), where given a question and a passage, the learner must select some span in the passage as an answer, are known to be brittle.By inserting a single nuisance sentence into the passage, an adversary can fool the model into selecting the wrong span.A promising new approach for QA decomposes the task into two stages:(i) select relevant sentences from the passage; and(ii) select a span among those sentences.Intuitively, if the sentence selector excludes the offending sentence, then the downstream span selector will be robust.While recent work has hinted at the potential robustness of two-stage QA, these methods have never, to our knowledge, been explicitly combined with adversarial training.This paper offers a thorough empirical investigation of adversarial robustness, demonstrating that although the two-stage approach lags behind single-stage span selection, adversarial training improves its performance significantly, leading to an improvement of over 22 points in F1 score over the adversarially-trained single-stage model.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],SJeB-KQHnm,On the Effectiveness of Minimal Context Selection for Robust Question Answering,"Une approche en deux étapes, consistant en une sélection de phrases suivie d'une sélection d'empan, peut être rendue plus robuste aux attaques adverses par rapport à un modèle à une étape entraîné sur le contexte complet."

"Still in 2019, many scanned documents come into businesses in non-digital format.Text to be extracted from real world documents is often nestled inside rich formatting, such as tabular structures or forms with fill-in-the-blank boxes or underlines whose ink often touches or even strikes through the ink of the text itself.Such ink artifacts can severely interfere with the performance of recognition algorithms or other downstream processing tasks.In this work, we propose DeepErase, a neural preprocessor to erase ink artifacts from text images.We devise a method to programmatically augment text images with real artifacts, and use them to train a segmentation network in an weakly supervised manner.In additional to high segmentation accuracy, we show that our cleansed images achieve a significant boost in downstream recognition accuracy by popular OCR software such as Tesseract 4.0.We test DeepErase on out-of-distribution datasets (NIST SDB) of scanned IRS tax return forms and achieve double-digit improvements in recognition accuracy over baseline for both printed and handwritten text.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SJgRf659Ur,DeepErase: Weakly Supervised Ink Artifact Removal in Document Text Images,"Suppression neuronale des artefacts d'encre des documents (soulignements, taches, etc.) sans données d'entraînement annotées manuellement."

"Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information.Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data:1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing.In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels.We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors.Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction.Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data.Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets.Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance.Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygqqsA9KX,Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations,"Nous proposons un modèle pour apprendre des représentations multimodales factorisées qui sont discriminantes, génératives et interprétables."

"Existing neural networks are vulnerable to ""adversarial examples""---created by adding maliciously designed small perturbations in inputs to induce a misclassification by the networks.The most investigated defense strategy is adversarial training which augments training data with adversarial examples.However, applying single-step adversaries in adversarial training does not support the robustness of the networks, instead, they will even make the networks to be overfitted.In contrast to the single-step, multi-step training results in the state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and CIFAR10, yet it needs a massive amount of time.Therefore, we propose a method, Stochastic Quantized Activation (SQA) that solves overfitting problems in single-step adversarial training and fastly achieves the robustness comparable to the multi-step.SQA attenuates the adversarial effects by providing random selectivity to activation functions and allows the network to learn robustness with only single-step training.Throughout the experiment, our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art robustness against one of the strongest white-box attacks as PGD training, but with much less computational cost.Finally, we visualize the learning process of the network with SQA to handle strong adversaries, which is different from existing methods.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],ryxeB30cYX,Stochastic Quantized Activation: To prevent Overfitting in Fast Adversarial Training,Cet article propose l'activation quantifiée stochastique qui résout les problèmes de surajustement dans la formation adverse FGSM et atteint rapidement une robustesse comparable à la formation en plusieurs étapes.

Subset Scanning allows us to answer the question: ""``Which subset of inputs have larger-than-expected activations at which subset of nodes?""  Framing the adversarial detection problem this way allows us to identify systematic patterns in the activation space that span multiple adversarially noised images.  Such images are ``""weird together"".  Leveraging this common anomalous pattern, we show increased detection power as the proportion of noised images increases in a test set.   Detection power and accuracy results are provided for targeted adversarial noise added to CIFAR-10 images on a 20-layer ResNet using the Basic Iterative Method attack.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],Skld1aVtPB,Deep Mining: Detecting Anomalous Patterns in Neural Network Activations with Subset Scanning,"L'article propose un schéma de détection de la présence d'entrées anormales basé sur une approche de ""balayage de sous-ensembles"" pour détecter les activations anormales dans le réseau d'apprentissage profond."

"Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.In relation to the structure of the landscape, we study the permutation symmetry of neurons in each layer of a deep neural network, which gives rise not only to multiple equivalent global minima of the loss function but also to critical points in between partner minima.In a network of $d-1$ hidden layers with $n_k$ neurons in layers $k = 1, \ldots, d$, we construct continuous paths between equivalent global minima that lead through a `permutation point' where the input and output weight vectors of two neurons in the same hidden layer $k$ collide and interchange.We show that such permutation points are critical points which lie inside high-dimensional subspaces of equal loss, contributing to the global flatness of the landscape.We also find that a permutation point for the exchange of neurons $i$ and $j$ transits into a flat high-dimensional plateau that enables all $n_k!$permutations of neurons in a given layer $k$ at the same loss value. Moreover, we introduce higher-order permutation points by exploiting the hierarchical structure in the loss landscapes of neural networks, and find that the number of $K$-th order permutation points is much larger than the (already huge) number of equivalent global minima -- at least by a polynomial factor of order $K$. In twotasks, we demonstrate numerically with our path finding method that continuous paths between partner minima exist: first, in a toy network with a single hidden layer on a function approximation task and, second, in a multilayer network on the MNIST task.

"Network pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing the size of deep neural networks.Pruning uncovers high-performance subnetworks by taking a trained dense network and gradually removing unimportant connections.Recently, alternative techniques have emerged for training sparse networks directly without having to train a large dense model beforehand, thereby achieving small memory footprints during both training and inference.These techniques are based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters during training.Thus, they are in effect executing a training-time search for the optimal subnetwork.We investigate a most recent one of these techniques and conduct additional experiments to elucidate its behavior in training sparse deep convolutional networks.Dynamic parameter reallocation converges early during training to a highly trainable subnetwork.We show that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the discovered high-performance subnetwork is sufficient to explain its good performance.Rather, it is the dynamics of parameter reallocation that are responsible for successful learning.Dynamic parameter reallocation thus improves the trainability of deep convolutional networks, playing a similar role as overparameterization, without incurring the memory and computational cost of the latter.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],BygIWTMdjX,Dynamic parameter reallocation improves trainability of deep convolutional networks,"La réaffectation dynamique des paramètres permet de réussir l'apprentissage direct de réseaux compacts et épars, et joue un rôle indispensable même lorsque nous connaissons a priori le réseau épars optimal."

"Backpropagation is driving today's artificial neural networks (ANNs).However, despite extensive research, it remains unclear if the brain implements this algorithm.Among neuroscientists, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are often seen as a realistic alternative: neurons can randomly introduce change, and use unspecific feedback signals to observe their effect on the cost and thus approximate their gradient.However, the convergence rate of such learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons.Here we propose a hybrid learning approach.Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide.We provide proof that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of networks.In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match the performance of gradient-based learning.Learning feedback weights provides a biologically plausible mechanism of achieving good performance, without the need for precise, pre-specified learning rules.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],ByeUBANtvB,Learning to solve the credit assignment problem,Les perturbations peuvent être utilisées pour former les poids de rétroaction afin d'apprendre dans les réseaux neuronaux entièrement connectés et convolutifs.

"This paper proposes and demonstrates a surprising pattern in the training of neural networks: there is a one to one relation between the values of any pair of losses (such as cross entropy, mean squared error, 0/1 error etc.) evaluated for a model arising at (any point of) a training run.This pattern is universal in the sense that this one to one relationship is identical across architectures (such as VGG, Resnet, Densenet etc.), algorithms (SGD and SGD with momentum) and training loss functions (cross entropy and mean squared error).","[1, 0]",[],H1e2wNB3hV,Universality Patterns in the Training of Neural Networks,"Nous identifions certains modèles universels (c.-à-d. qui sont valables pour toutes les architectures) dans le comportement de différentes pertes de substitution (CE, MSE, perte 0-1) lors de la formation de réseaux neuronaux et nous présentons des preuves empiriques à l'appui."
