"Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs.MPT is typically used in combination with a technique called loss scaling, that works by scaling up the loss value up before the start of backpropagation in order to minimize the impact of numerical underflow on training.Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages.We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter.We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods.We present experimental results on a variety of networks and tasks that show our approach can shorten the time to convergence and improve accuracy, compared with using the existing state-of-the-art MPT and single-precision floating point.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.2399999958000001, 0.26086956082230633, 0.19999999531250012, 0.38095237636054424, 0.2051282003944774, 0.2978723360796741]",rJlnfaNYvB,Adaptive Loss Scaling for Mixed Precision Training,﻿Nous concevons un échelonnement adaptatif des pertes pour améliorer l'apprentissage de la précision mixte qui surpasse les résultats de l'état de l'art.

"Universal probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) provide a powerful framework for specifying rich and complex probabilistic models.However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of substantially complicating the process of drawing inferences from the model.In particular, inference can become challenging when the support of the model varies between executions.Though general-purpose inference engines have been designed to operate in such settings, they are typically inefficient, often relying on proposing from the prior to make transitions.To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine (DCC).DCC divides the program into separate straight-line sub-programs, each of which has a fixed support allowing more powerful inference algorithms to be run locally, before recombining their outputs in a principled fashion.We show how DCC can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine, and empirically confirm that it can provide substantial performance improvements over previous approaches.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.14634145877453913, 0.09756097096966114, 0.19999999545000013, 0.11764705382545197, 0.34999999545000005, 0.1754385915297016, 0.19230768730769243]",Syx2tJnNtr,"Divide, Conquer, and Combine: a New Inference Strategy for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support","Diviser, Conquérir et Combiner est un nouveau schéma d'inférence qui peut être exécuté sur les programmes probabilistes à support stochastique, c'est-à-dire que l'existence même des variables est stochastique."
"Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a socialnetwork or a product purchase network) is an important task because the way anetwork functions is often determined by its communities.The traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based approaches,which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics thatseek to maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those betweenthem.Node embedding approaches, which represent each node in a graph as areal-valued vector, transform the problem of community detection in a graph tothat of clustering a set of vectors.Existing node embedding approaches are primarilybased on first initiating uniform random walks from each node to constructa context of a node and then seeks to make the vector representation ofthe node close to its context.However, standard node embedding approaches donot directly take into account the community structure of a network while constructingthe context around each node.To alleviate this, we explore two differentthreads of work.First, we investigate the use of biased random walks (specifically,maximum entropy based walks) to obtain more centrality preserving embeddingof nodes, which we hypothesize may lead to more effective clusters in the embeddedspace.Second, we propose a community structure aware node embeddingapproach where we incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics intothe objective function of node embedding.We demonstrate that our proposed approachfor community detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselinesas well as K-means on a standard node-embedded vector space (specifically,node2vec) on a wide range of real-life networks of different sizes and densities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.23529411292387553, 0.1176470541003462, 0.06666666246666693, 0.13333332913333346, 0.13333332913333346, 0.12499999548828142, 0.2499999954882813, 0.36363635900826446, 0.2962962928395062, 0.14814814469135812, 0.12121211658402223, 0.24242423779614333, 0.14814814469135812, 0.14814814469135812, 0.23529411292387553, 0.15384615073964505, 0.0, 0.0833333311458334, 0.12903225369406884, 0.19354838272632682, 0.3428571380571429, 0.2666666624666667, 0.0, 0.2962962928395062, 0.07407407061728412, 0.2666666624666667, 0.19354838272632682, 0.18181817719008275]",H1gQY64FwB,COMMUNITY PRESERVING NODE EMBEDDING,Un algorithme d'incorporation de nœuds préservant les communautés qui permet une détection plus efficace des communautés avec un regroupement sur l'espace incorporé.

This setting corresponds to that which human learners face as they acquire domain expertise, for example, as an individual reads a textbook chapter-by-chapter.Through simulations involving sequences of 10 related tasks, we find reason for optimism that nets will scale well as they advance from having a single skill to becoming domain experts.We observed two key phenomena.First, forward facilitation---the accelerated learning of task n+1 having learned n previous tasks---grows with n. Second, backward interference---the forgetting of the n previous tasks when learning task n+1---diminishes with n.  Forward facilitation is the goal of research on metalearning, and reduced backward interference is the goal of research on ameliorating catastrophic forgetting.We find that both of these goals are attained simply through broader exposure to a domain.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.5217391256710776, 0.14999999505000017, 0.1666666619791668, 0.08695651833648407, 0.15384614931952675, 0.17647058325259532]",Bygi-YNNC4,Scaling characteristics of sequential multitask learning: Networks naturally learn to learn,Nous étudions le comportement d'un CNN lorsqu'il maîtrise de nouvelles tâches tout en conservant la maîtrise des tâches apprises précédemment.

"The phase problem in diffraction physics is one of the oldest inverse problems in all of science.The central difficulty that any approach to solving this inverse problem must overcome is that half of the information, namely the phase of the diffracted beam, is always missing.In the context of electron microscopy, the phase problem is generally non-linear and solutions provided by phase-retrieval techniques are known to be poor approximations to the physics of electrons interacting with matter.Here, we show that a semi-supervised learning approach can effectively solve the phase problem in electron microscopy/scattering.In particular, we introduce a new Deep Neural Network (DNN), Y-net, which simultaneously learns a reconstruction algorithm via supervised training in addition to learning a physics-based regularization via unsupervised training.We demonstrate that this constrained, semi-supervised approach is an order of magnitude more data-efficient and accurate than the same model trained in a purely supervised fashion.In addition, the architecture of the Y-net model provides for a straightforward evaluation of the consistency of the model's prediction during inference and is generally applicable to the phase problem in other settings.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.3124999950195313, 0.2439024341701369, 0.26666666196543215, 0.41176470088235295, 0.18604650684694443, 0.2790697626608979, 0.31818181344008273]",Bygi2739Lr,Y-net: A Physics-constrained and Semi-supervised Learning Approach to the Phase Problem in Computational Electron Imaging,Nous introduisons un réseau de neurones profonds semi-supervisé pour approximer la solution du problème de phase en microscopie électronique.

"A key goal in neuroscience is to understand brain mechanisms of cognitive functions.An emerging approach is to study “brain states” dynamics using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).So far in the literature, brain states have typically been studied using 30 seconds of fMRI data or more, and it is unclear to which extent brain states can be reliably identified from very short time series.In this project, we applied graph convolutional networks (GCN) to decode brain activity over short time windows in a task fMRI dataset, i.e. associate a given window of fMRI time series with the task used.Starting with a populational brain graph with nodes defined by a parcellation of cerebral cortex and the adjacent matrix extracted from functional connectome, GCN takes a short series of fMRI volumes as input, generates high-level domain-specific graph representations, and then predicts the corresponding cognitive state.We investigated the performance of this GCN ""cognitive state annotation"" in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database, which features 21 different experimental conditions spanning seven major cognitive domains, and high temporal resolution task fMRI data.Using a 10-second window, the 21 cognitive states were identified with an excellent average test accuracy of 89% (chance level 4.8%).As the HCP task battery was designed to selectively activate a wide range of specialized functional networks, we anticipate the GCN annotation to be applicable as a base model for other transfer learning applications, for instance, adapting to new task domains.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.05714285247346978, 0.0, 0.14035087245306266, 0.22222221739369008, 0.19999999535555565, 0.2499999952295919, 0.40909090409090915, 0.2105263110495538]",HJenmmF8Ir,Functional Annotation of Human Cognitive States using Graph Convolution Networks,"En utilisant une fenêtre de 10s de signaux IRMf, notre modèle GCN a identifié 21 conditions de tâches différentes à partir de l'ensemble de données HCP avec une précision de test de 89%."
"Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) require high memory consumption and large computational loads.  In order to deploy DNN algorithms efficiently on edge or mobile devices, a series of DNN compression algorithms have been explored, including the line of works on factorization methods.Factorization methods approximate the weight matrix of a DNN layer with multiplication of two or multiple low-rank matrices.However, it is hard to measure the ranks of DNN layers during the training process.Previous works mainly induce low-rank through implicit approximations or via costly singular value decomposition (SVD) process on every training step.The former approach usually induces a high accuracy loss while the latter prevents DNN factorization from efficiently reaching a high compression rate.In this work, we propose SVD training, which first applies SVD to decompose DNN's layers and then performs training on the full-rank decomposed weights.To improve the training quality and convergence, we add orthogonality regularization to the singular vectors, which ensure the valid form of SVD and avoid gradient vanishing/exploding.Low-rank is encouraged by applying sparsity-inducing regularizers on the singular values of each layer.Singular value pruning is applied at the end to reach a low-rank model.We empirically show that SVD training can significantly reduce the rank of DNN layers and achieve higher reduction on computation load under the same accuracy, comparing to not only previous factorization methods but also state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.266666661688889, 0.0, 0.12121211621671278, 0.06666666168888927, 0.22222221728395072, 0.0, 0.1538461490072322, 0.20512820028928347, 0.13333332835555575, 0.0689655122948874, 0.11538461112426052]",SJeNA6EtDB,Learning Low-rank Deep Neural Networks via Singular Vector Orthogonality Regularization and Singular Value Sparsification,Induction efficace de réseaux neuronaux profonds à faible rang via l'apprentissage SVD avec des valeurs singulières éparses et des vecteurs singuliers orthogonaux.

"Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy, since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have different amounts of redundancy.The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN) directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead.To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs.However, prior works use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN, because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too large.The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results.It is difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) DDPG-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can achieve reasonable inference accuracy.In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for each activation layer.Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the inference latency by 54.06%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by 50.69%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.05405404914536203, 0.04444443986172887, 0.06060605561065239, 0.11764705384083066, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04878048304580653, 0.04651162323418111]",rygfnn4twS,AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ,"Quantification précise, rapide et automatisée d'un réseau neuronal à noyau avec une précision mixte à l'aide de l'apprentissage par renforcement profond hiérarchique."

"Through many recent advances in graph representation learning, performance achieved on tasks involving graph-structured data has substantially increased in recent years---mostly on tasks involving node-level predictions.The setup of prediction tasks over entire graphs (such as property prediction for a molecule, or side-effect prediction for a drug), however, proves to be more challenging, as the algorithm must combine evidence about several structurally relevant patches of the graph into a single prediction.Most prior work attempts to predict these graph-level properties while considering only one graph at a time---not allowing the learner to directly leverage structural similarities and motifs across graphs.Here we propose a setup in which a graph neural network receives pairs of graphs at once, and extend it with a co-attentional layer that allows node representations to easily exchange structural information across them.We first show that such a setup provides natural benefits on a pairwise graph classification task (drug-drug interaction prediction), and then expand to a more generic graph regression setup: enhancing predictions over QM9, a standard molecular prediction benchmark.Our setup is flexible, powerful and makes no assumptions about the underlying dataset properties, beyond anticipating the existence of multiple training graphs.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.1176470541003462, 0.11999999615200012, 0.14634145908387877, 0.17391303942344055, 0.25531914493435953, 0.1176470541003462]",BJeRykBKDH,Empowering Graph Representation Learning with Paired Training and Graph Co-Attention,Nous utilisons la co-attention des graphes dans un système de formation de graphes appariés pour la classification et la régression des graphes.

"We present Newtonian Monte Carlo (NMC), a method to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence by analyzing the first and second order gradients of the target density to determine a suitable proposal density at each point.Existing first order gradient-based methods suffer from the problem of determining an appropriate step size.Too small a step size and it will take a large number of steps to converge, while a very large step size will cause it to overshoot the high density region.NMC is similar to the Newton-Raphson update in optimization where the second order gradient is used to automatically scale the step size in each dimension.However, our objective is not to find a maxima but instead to find a parameterized density that can best match the local curvature of the target density.  This parameterized density is then used as a single-site Metropolis-Hastings proposal.As a further improvement on first order methods, we show that random variables with constrained supports don't need to be transformed before taking a gradient step.NMC directly matches constrained random variables to a proposal density with the same support thus keeping the curvature of the target density intact.We demonstrate the efficiency of NMC on a number of different domains.For statistical models where the prior is conjugate to the likelihood, our method recovers the posterior quite trivially in one step.However, we also show results on fairly large non-conjugate models, where NMC performs better than adaptive first order methods such as NUTS or other inexact scalable inference methods such as Stochastic Variational Inference or bootstrapping.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.13636363220041336, 0.21428570931122462, 0.16666666205246927, 0.12121211643709846, 0.22222221760802477, 0.0, 0.05263157444598377, 0.23529411292387553, 0.16666666170138905, 0.12499999517578143, 0.0888888847802471]",SklKcJ3EFH,Newtonian Monte Carlo: a second-order gradient method for speeding up MCMC,Exploiter la courbure pour que les méthodes MCMC convergent plus rapidement que l'état de l'art.

"Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself.These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values.However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among \textit{(domain, slot)} pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns.In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots.In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level.Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.16949152042516535, 0.0, 0.05405404923301723, 0.17391303856332718, 0.1791044726665183, 0.32352940683391007]",H1e_cC4twS,Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking,"Nous proposons le premier modèle neuronal non autorégressif pour le suivi de l'état du dialogue (DST), atteignant la précision SOTA (49,04%) sur le benchmark MultiWOZ2.1, et réduisant la latence d'inférence d'un ordre de grandeur."

"Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture.In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely  Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut.This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels.We solve it by introducing  edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search.Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability.Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.Our code has been made available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/on9lg3rpx1r6dkf/AABG5mt0sMHjnEJyoRnLEYW4a?dl=0.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.1951219468887568, 0.13043477855387536, 0.12903225319458916, 0.0, 0.181818177043159, 0.105263153393352, 0.0, 0.13043477855387536, 0.0]",BJlS634tPr,PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search,Permettre la connexion partielle de canaux dans les super-réseaux pour régulariser et accélérer la recherche d'architectures différentiables

"Variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are approximate posterior inference algorithms that are often said to have complementary strengths, with VI being fast but biased and MCMC being slower but asymptotically unbiased.In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think.In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow.This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to too few warmup steps) may track that of VI (due to too few optimization steps), up to differences due to VI’s parameterization and asymptotic bias.Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and momentum-accelerated versions) do evolve similarly.This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it’s far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.18518518024691372, 0.25531914393843375, 0.21818181326281003, 0.19607842638985018, 0.24999999520000007, 0.17647058366782017]",HJggcy2NFS,Langevin Dynamics as Nonparametric Variational Inference,"Le comportement transitoire des algorithmes MCMC et d'inférence variationnelle basés sur le gradient est plus similaire qu'on pourrait le croire, ce qui remet en question l'affirmation selon laquelle l'inférence variationnelle est plus rapide que le MCMC."

"Image translation between two domains is a class of problems aiming to learn mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the target domain.It has been applied to numerous applications, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training.When paired training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed problem.We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term.We further notice that existing image translation techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce unwanted changes or artifacts to the input.Thus we propose to add an attention module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process.The module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes.The predicted attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection.Extensive experiments and evaluations show that our model while being simpler, achieves significantly better performance than existing image translation methods.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.16216215760409072, 0.13793102953626654, 0.15384614884615402, 0.31372548639753944, 0.22222221760802477, 0.21428570931122462, 0.058823524688581694, 0.275862064019025, 0.24242423764921955]",rygypo0qtm,"Show, Attend and Translate: Unsupervised Image Translation with Self-Regularization and Attention",Nous proposons un modèle génératif simple pour la traduction non supervisée d'images et la détection de la saillance.
"Building deep neural networks to control autonomous agents which have to interact in real-time with the physical world, such as robots or automotive vehicles, requires a seamless integration of time into a network’s architecture.The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components.Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units.For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner.In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel.In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases.These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing.Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections.We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity.We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks.Additionally, we provide a toolbox to design, train, evaluate, and online-interact with layerwise-parallel networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.33333332835555557, 0.23076922579881665, 0.25454544954710745, 0.3673469338775511, 0.1951219468887568, 0.23809523365079371, 0.2553191441195111, 0.3571428521428572, 0.22580644665972954, 0.20512820107823804, 0.47619047174603185]",SkfNU2e0Z,Statestream: A toolbox to explore layerwise-parallel deep neural networks,"Nous définissons un concept de réseaux neuronaux profonds à modèles parallèles par couches, pour lesquels les couches fonctionnent en parallèle, et nous fournissons une boîte à outils pour concevoir, former, évaluer et interagir en ligne avec ces réseaux."

"Developing effective biologically plausible learning rules for deep neural networks is important for advancing connections between deep learning and neuroscience.To date, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks.In this work, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically motivated learning rules.Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding any biologically implausible weight transport.It can be shown mathematically that this approach has sufficient expressivity to approximate any online learning algorithm.Our experiments show that the meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures.Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that this model outperforms a state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning algorithm for continual learning on regression and classification benchmarks.This approach represents a step toward biologically plausible learning mechanisms that can not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.2941176420588236, 0.15384614892833676, 0.43243242746530314, 0.12121211621671278, 0.23529411264705893, 0.16666666168209893, 0.21052631084487544, 0.14999999511250017]",HklfNQFL8H,Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity,Les réseaux qui apprennent avec des connexions de rétroaction et des règles de plasticité locale peuvent être optimisés en utilisant le méta-apprentissage.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, Inception-v3, densenet-161, and VGG-16bn networks on the ImageNet classification benchmark that, at 8-bit precision exceed the accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks after one epoch of finetuning, thereby leveraging the availability of pretrained models.We also demonstrate ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 4-bit models that match the accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks -- the highest scores to date.Surprisingly, the weights of the low-precision networks are very close (in cosine similarity) to the weights of the corresponding baseline networks, making training from scratch unnecessary.We find that gradient noise due to quantization during training increases with reduced precision, and seek ways to overcome this noise.The number of iterations required by stochastic gradient descent to achieve a given training error is related to the square of (a) the distance of the initial solution from the final plus (b) the maximum variance of the gradient estimates.  By drawing inspiration from this observation, we (a) reduce solution distance by starting with pretrained fp32 precision baseline networks and fine-tuning, and (b) combat noise introduced by quantizing weights and activations during training, by using larger batches along with matched learning rate annealing.

"Supervised deep learning requires a large amount of training samples with annotations (e.g. label class for classification task, pixel- or voxel-wised label map for segmentation tasks), which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain.During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are fed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of equal importance.However, some of the samples may become less informative during training, as the magnitude of the gradient start to vanish for these samples.In the meantime, other samples of higher utility or hardness may be more demanded for the training process to proceed and require more exploitation.To address the challenges of expensive annotations and loss of sample informativeness, here we propose a novel training framework which adaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process.The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware strategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model.To evaluate the proposed training framework, we perform experiments on three different datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification task and a medical image dataset IVUS for biophysical simulation task.On all three datasets, the proposed framework outperforms a random sampling method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.12765957012222742, 0.10526315311634371, 0.058823524480969266, 0.05405404923301723, 0.0930232512709575, 0.3999999951020409, 0.09523809064625872, 0.18749999501953143]",Byl3HxBFwH,Efficient Deep Representation Learning by Adaptive Latent Space Sampling,Cet article présente un cadre pour l'apprentissage de représentation efficace en termes de données par échantillonnage adaptatif dans l'espace latent.

"In recent years, the efficiency and even the feasibility of traditional load-balancing policies are challenged by the rapid growth of cloud infrastructure with increasing levels of server heterogeneity and increasing size of cloud services and applications.In such many software-load-balancers heterogeneous systems, traditional solutions, such as JSQ, incur an increasing communication overhead, whereas low-communication alternatives, such as JSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ scheme are either unstable or provide poor performance.We argue that a better low-communication load balancing scheme can be established by allowing each dispatcher to have a different view of the system and keep using JSQ, rather than greedily trying to avoid starvation on a per-decision basis. accordingly, we introduce the Loosely-Shortest -Queue family of load balancing algorithms.Roughly speaking, in Loosely-shortest -Queue, each dispatcher keeps a different approximation of the server queue lengths and routes jobs to the shortest among them.Communication is used only to update the approximations and make sure that they are not too far from the real queue lengths in expectation.We formally establish the strong stability of any Loosely-Shortest -Queue policy and provide an easy-to-verify sufficient condition for verifying that a policy is Loosely-Shortest -Queue.We further demonstrate that the Loosely-Shortest -Queue approach allows constructing throughput optimal policies with an arbitrarily low communication budget.Finally, using extensive simulations that consider homogeneous, heterogeneous and highly skewed heterogeneous systems in scenarios with a single dispatcher as well as with multiple dispatchers, we show that the examined Loosely-Shortest -Queue example policies are always stable as dictated by theory.Moreover, it exhibits an appealing performance and significantly outperforms well-known low-communication policies, such as JSQ(d) and JIQ, while using a similar communication budget.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.08695651689035944, 0.11538461074704161, 0.14285713837372463, 0.13333332868888906, 0.04761904266439961, 0.04761904266439961, 0.1463414584414041, 0.20512820013149255, 0.10909090456859524, 0.09756097063652613]",BJxN9Hvf-V,Load Balancing in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Systems with Multiple Dispatchers,"Solution d'équilibrage de charge évolutive et à faible communication pour les systèmes multi-dispatcheurs à serveurs hétérogènes, avec de solides garanties théoriques et des résultats empiriques prometteurs.

"Momentum based stochastic gradient methods such as heavy ball (HB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method are widely used in practice for training deep networks and other supervised learning models, as they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent (SGD).Rigorously speaking, fast gradient methods have provable improvements over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are exact.In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts, resulting in some practical gain.This work provides a counterpoint to this belief by proving that there exist simple problem instances where these methods cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters.These negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look like carefully constructed pathological instances.These results suggest (along with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a by-product of minibatching.Furthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which, on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and SGD's performance.This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based on a relatively less popular variant of Nesterov's Acceleration.Extensive empirical results in this paper show that ASGD has performance gains over HB, NAG, and SGD.The code for implementing the ASGD Algorithm can be found at https://github.com/rahulkidambi/AccSGD.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.31746031256235835, 0.13043477775992457, 0.10714285214923494, 0.0, 0.08888888408888915, 0.04255318660027218, 0.0769230719304737, 0.11764705384083066, 0.09090908616735562, 0.0]",rJTutzbA-,On the insufficiency of existing momentum schemes for Stochastic Optimization,"Les schémas de momentum/accélération existants, tels que la méthode de la boule lourde et l'accélération de Nesterov, employés avec des gradients stochastiques, ne sont pas meilleurs que la descente de gradient stochastique vanille, en particulier lorsqu'ils sont employés avec des lots de petite taille."

"Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested.One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks.For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers.Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned.This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all?Is it important?Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance?If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence?In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers.(2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters.(3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification.(4) Pooling confers \emph{too much} deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to \emph{counteract} this inductive bias.Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions about the working of neural networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.09756097061273078, 0.1111111062500002, 0.06896551324613578, 0.1111111062500002, 0.0, 0.14814814469135812, 0.12903225369406884, 0.2333333287833334, 0.18604650663061129, 0.14634145841760873, 0.13636363137396712, 0.19230768749260366]",HJeuOiRqKQ,Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs,Nous constatons que le pooling seul ne détermine pas la stabilité de la déformation dans les CNN et que la fluidité du filtre joue un rôle important dans la détermination de la stabilité.

"Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.  While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents.The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow.  We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.

"We review eight machine learning classification algorithms to analyze Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in order to distinguish EEG patterns associated with five basic educational tasks.There is a large variety of classifiers being used in this EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) field.While previous EEG experiments used several classifiers in the same experiments or reviewed different algorithms on datasets from different experiments, our approach focuses on review eight classifier categories on the same dataset, including linear classifiers, non-linear Bayesian classifiers, nearest neighbour classifiers, ensemble methods, adaptive classifiers, tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning.Besides, we intend to find an approach which can run smoothly on the current mainstream personal computers and smartphones.  The empirical evaluation demonstrated that Random Forest and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform other approaches.We used a data set which users were conducting five frequently-conduct learning-related tasks, including reading, writing, and typing.Results showed that these best two algorithms could correctly classify different users with an accuracy increase of  5% to 9%, use each task independently.Within each subject, the tasks could be recognized with an accuracy increase of  4% to 7%, compared with other approaches.This work suggests that Random Forest could be a recommended approach (fast and accurate) for current mainstream hardware, while LSTM has the potential to be the first-choice approach when the mainstream computers and smartphones can process more data in a shorter time.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.06060605638200213, 0.1538461491124262, 0.07843136939638615, 0.06666666222222252, 0.0, 0.071428566836735, 0.0, 0.0, 0.044444440987654585]",BkxmOn4FwH,Ensemble methods and LSTM outperformed other eight machine learning classifiers in an EEG-based BCI experiment,Deux algorithmes ont obtenu de meilleurs résultats que huit autres lors d'une expérience de BCI basée sur l'EEG.

"The goal of few-shot learning is to learn a classifier that generalizes well even when trained with a limited number of training instances per class.The recently introduced meta-learning approaches tackle this problem by learning a generic classifier across a large number of multiclass classification tasks and generalizing the model to a new task.Yet, even with such meta-learning, the low-data problem in the novel classification task still remains.In this paper, we propose Transductive Propagation Network (TPN), a novel meta-learning framework for transductive inference that classifies the entire test set at once to alleviate the low-data problem.Specifically, we propose to learn to propagate labels from labeled instances to unlabeled test instances, by learning a graph construction module that exploits the manifold structure in the data.TPN jointly learns both the parameters of feature embedding and the graph construction in an end-to-end manner.

"Adversarial examples are modified samples that preserve original image structures but deviate classifiers.Researchers have put efforts into developing methods for generating adversarial examples and finding out origins.Past research put much attention on decision boundary changes caused by these methods.This paper, in contrast, discusses the origin of adversarial examples from a more underlying knowledge representation point of view.Human beings can learn and classify prototypes as well as transformations of objects.While neural networks store learned knowledge in a more hybrid way of combining all prototypes and transformations as a whole distribution.Hybrid storage may lead to lower distances between different classes so that small modifications can mislead the classifier.A one-step distribution imitation method is designed to imitate distribution of the nearest different class neighbor.Experiments show that simply by imitating distributions from a training set without any knowledge of the classifier can still lead to obvious impacts on classification results from deep networks.It also implies that adversarial examples can be in more forms than small perturbations.Potential ways of alleviating adversarial examples are discussed from the representation point of view.The first path is to change the encoding of data sent to the training step.Training data that are more prototypical can help seize more robust and accurate structural knowledge.The second path requires constructing learning frameworks with improved representations.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.07407406908093313, 0.27586206397146257, 0.0, 0.37499999507812504, 0.1538461488757398, 0.2941176422145329, 0.12499999507812519, 0.06896551224732497, 0.14285713841269856, 0.2142857092857144, 0.2962962913031551, 0.07407406908093313, 0.14285713785714302, 0.0]",BylRVjC9K7,Explaining Adversarial Examples with Knowledge Representation,Le stockage et la représentation hybrides des connaissances acquises peuvent être à l'origine d'exemples contradictoires.

"We study the evolution of internal representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory.The theory suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower compression phase, in which the mutual information I(X;T) between the input X and internal representations T decreases.Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true I(X;T) over these networks is provably either constant (discrete X) or infinite (continuous X).This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works.To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which I(X;T) is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters.This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations.We then develop a rigorous estimator for I(X;T) in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models.By relating I(X;T) in the noisy DNN to an information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same class.Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that meaningful clusters form in the T space.Finally, we return to the estimator of I(X;T) employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for clustering.This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of interest.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.1176470541003462, 0.0, 0.09756097127900079, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.048780483474122935, 0.0, 0.04651162368848064, 0.0]",HkxOoiAcYX,Estimating Information Flow in DNNs,"Les réseaux neuronaux profonds déterministes ne rejettent pas d'informations, mais ils regroupent leurs entrées."

"Multimodal sentiment analysis is a core research area that studies speaker sentiment expressed from the language, visual, and acoustic modalities.The central challenge in multimodal learning involves inferring joint representations that can process and relate information from these modalities.However, existing work learns joint representations using multiple modalities as input and may be sensitive to noisy or missing modalities at test time.With the recent success of sequence to sequence models in machine translation, there is an opportunity to explore new ways of learning joint representations that may not require all input modalities at test time.In this paper, we propose a method to learn robust joint representations by translating between modalities.Our method is based on the key insight that translation from a source to a target modality provides a method of learning joint representations using only the source modality as input.We augment modality translations with a cycle consistency loss to ensure that our joint representations retain maximal information from all modalities.Once our translation model is trained with paired multimodal data, we only need data from the source modality at test-time for prediction.This ensures that our model remains robust from perturbations or missing target modalities.We train our model with a coupled translation-prediction objective and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on multimodal sentiment analysis datasets: CMU-MOSI, ICT-MMMO, and YouTube.Additional experiments show that our model learns increasingly discriminative joint representations with more input modalities while maintaining robustness to perturbations of all other modalities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.16666666168209893, 0.22222221723765442, 0.2564102514924393, 0.166666662092014, 0.42424241924701567, 0.19047618565759653, 0.3684210476869806, 0.05128204636423453, 0.2666666617555556, 0.14999999511250017, 0.29999999511250003]",rkgx8x1js7,Learning Robust Joint Representations for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,Nous présentons un modèle qui apprend des représentations conjointes robustes en effectuant des traductions cycliques hiérarchiques entre plusieurs modalités.

Specifically, we show that adversarial training with the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), when combined with random initialization, is as effective as PGD-based training but has significantly lower cost.  Furthermore we show that FGSM adversarial training can be further accelerated by using standard techniques for efficient training of deep networks, allowing us to learn a robust CIFAR10 classifier with 45% robust accuracy at epsilon=8/255 in 6 minutes, and a robust ImageNet classifier with 43% robust accuracy at epsilon=2/255 in 12 hours, in comparison to past work based on ``free'' adversarial training which took 10 and 50 hours to reach the same respective thresholds.","[0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.1538461488568049, 0.21917807730531066, 0.1724137881272296, 0.31460673703320297]",BJx040EFvH,Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training,La principale affirmation de cet article est qu'une stratégie simple de randomisation et de formation contradictoire par la méthode du signe du gradient rapide (FGSM) produit des réseaux neuronaux robustes.
"In seeking for sparse and efficient neural network models, many previous works investigated on enforcing L1 or L0 regularizers to encourage weight sparsity during training.The L0 regularizer measures the parameter sparsity directly and is invariant to the scaling of parameter values.But it cannot provide useful gradients and therefore requires complex optimization techniques.The L1 regularizer is almost everywhere differentiable and can be easily optimized with gradient descent.Yet it is not scale-invariant and causes the same shrinking rate to all parameters, which is inefficient in increasing sparsity.Inspired by the Hoyer measure (the ratio between L1 and L2 norms) used in traditional compressed sensing problems, we present DeepHoyer, a set of sparsity-inducing regularizers that are both differentiable almost everywhere and scale-invariant.Our experiments show that enforcing DeepHoyer regularizers can produce even sparser neural network models than previous works, under the same accuracy level.We also show that DeepHoyer can be applied to both element-wise and structural pruning.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.2553191439565415, 0.21621621139517908, 0.05882352484429102, 0.27027026544923305, 0.1951219462462821, 0.18181817701818195, 0.09090908590909119, 0.2222222174691359]",rylBK34FDS,DeepHoyer: Learning Sparser Neural Network with Differentiable Scale-Invariant Sparsity Measures,"Nous proposons des régularisateurs presque partout différentiables et invariants d'échelle pour l'élagage des DNN, qui peuvent conduire à une sparsité supremum par le biais d'une formation SGD standard."

"Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising avenue to enhance the performance of deep neural networks on a target domain, using labels only from a source domain.However, the two predominant methods, domain discrepancy reduction learning and semi-supervised learning, are not readily applicable when source and target domains do not share a common label space.This paper addresses the above scenario by learning a representation space that retains discriminative power on both the (labeled) source and (unlabeled) target domains while keeping representations for the two domains well-separated.Inspired by a theoretical analysis, we first reformulate the disjoint classification task, where the source and target domains correspond to non-overlapping class labels, to a verification one.To handle both within and cross domain verifications, we propose a Feature Transfer Network (FTN) to separate the target feature space from the original source space while aligned with a transformed source space.Moreover, we present a non-parametric multi-class entropy minimization loss to further boost the discriminative power of FTNs on the target domain.In experiments, we first illustrate how FTN works in a controlled setting of adapting from MNIST-M to MNIST with disjoint digit classes between the two domains and then demonstrate the effectiveness of FTNs through state-of-the-art performances on a cross-ethnicity face recognition problem.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.1818181768285125, 0.127659569524672, 0.1199999951280002, 0.0888888839111114, 0.12244897469387774, 0.14634145841760873, 0.16393442171459296]",BklhAj09K7,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Distance Metric Learning,Une nouvelle théorie d'adaptation non supervisée du domaine pour l'apprentissage métrique à distance et son application à la reconnaissance des visages à travers diverses variations ethniques.

However, it has been observed that a model performing better with shared weights does not necessarily perform  better when trained alone.In this paper, we analyse existing weight sharing one-shot NAS approaches from a Bayesian point of view and identify the posterior fading problem, which compromises the effectiveness of shared weights.To alleviate this problem, we present a practical approach to guide the parameter posterior towards its true distribution.Moreover, a hard latency constraint is introduced during the search so that the desired latency can be achieved.The resulted method, namely Posterior Convergent NAS (PC-NAS), achieves state-of-the-art performance under standard GPU latency constraint on ImageNet.In our small search space, our model PC-NAS-S attains76.8% top-1 accuracy, 2.1% higher than MobileNetV2 (1.4x) with the same latency.When adopted to our large search space, PC-NAS-L achieves 78.1% top-1 accuracy within 11ms.The discovered architecture also transfers well to other computer vision applications such as object detection and person re-identification.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.3030302985858586, 0.18604650663061129, 0.047619042630386015, 0.2799999950720001, 0.1999999950500001, 0.15789473196675916, 0.04999999505000049, 0.09090908590909119, 0.05405404923301723, 0.09999999505000023]",HJgJNCEKPr,Improving One-Shot NAS By Suppressing The Posterior Fading,"Notre article identifie le problème de l'approche existante de partage de poids dans la recherche d'architecture neuronale et propose une méthode pratique, qui donne de bons résultats."

"In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator estimates the probability that the input data is real.The generator is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real.We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake,2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and3) in optimal settings, SGAN would be equivalent to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs.

"Knowledge bases, massive collections of facts (RDF triples) on diverse topics, support vital modern applications.However, existing knowledge bases contain very little data compared to the wealth of information on the Web.This is because the industry standard in knowledge base creation and augmentation suffers from a serious bottleneck: they rely on domain experts to identify appropriate web sources to extract data from.Efforts to fully automate knowledge extraction have failed to improve this standard: these automated systems are able to retrieve much more data and from a broader range of sources, but they suffer from very low precision and recall.As a result, these large-scale extractions remain unexploited.In this paper, we present MIDAS, a system that harnesses the results of automated knowledge extraction pipelines to repair the bottleneck in industrial knowledge creation and augmentation processes.MIDAS automates the suggestion of good-quality web sources and describes what to extract with respect to augmenting an existing knowledge base.We make three major contributions.First, we introduce a novel concept, web source slices, to describe the contents of a web source.Second, we define a profit function to quantify the value of a web source slice with respect to augmenting an existing knowledge base.Third, we develop effective and highly-scalable algorithms to derive high-profit web source slices.We demonstrate that MIDAS produces high-profit results and outperforms the baselines significantly on both real-word and synthetic datasets.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.06666666166666704, 0.12903225306971924, 0.31818181368801657, 0.040816322282382786, 0.0, 0.14634145877453913, 0.2285714236734695, 0.0, 0.06896551224732497, 0.1666666618055557, 0.071428566454082, 0.06249999501953165]",BketCg9p6X,MIDAS: Finding the Right Web Sources to Fill Knowledge Gaps,Cet article se concentre sur l'identification de sources web de haute qualité pour le pipeline d'augmentation des bases de connaissances industrielles.

"Training conditional generative latent-variable models is challenging in scenarios where the conditioning signal is very strong and the decoder is expressive enough to generate a plausible output given only the condition; the generative model tends to ignore the latent variable, suffering from posterior collapse.

A disentangled representation of a data set should be capable of recovering the underlying factors that generated it.One question that arises is whether using Euclidean space for latent variable models can produce a disentangled representation when the underlying generating factors have a certain geometrical structure.Take for example the images of a car seen from different angles.The angle has a periodic structure but a 1-dimensional representation would fail to capture this topology.How can we address this problem?The submissions presented for the first stage of the  NeurIPS2019 Disentanglement Challenge consist of a Diffusion Variational Autoencoder ($\Delta$VAE) with a hyperspherical latent space which can for example recover periodic true factors.The training of the $\Delta$VAE is enhanced by incorporating a modified version of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for tailoring the encoding capacity of the posterior approximate.,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.06896551239001224, 0.0, 0.08333332833333364, 0.07407406913580279, 0.0, 0.24999999580000004, 0.05882352484429102]",SylFDSU6Sr,Disentanglement with Hyperspherical Latent Spaces using Diffusion Variational Autoencoders,Description de la soumission au NeurIPS2019 Disentanglement Challenge basé sur des autoencodeurs variationnels hypersphériques

"Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely used technique in recent deep learning research to obtain small and simple models whose performance is on a par with their large and complex counterparts.Standard Knowledge Distillation tends to be time-consuming because of the training time spent to obtain a teacher model that would then provide guidance for the student model.It might be possible to cut short the time by training a teacher model on the fly, but it is not trivial to have such a high-capacity teacher that gives quality guidance to student models this way.To improve this, we present a novel framework of Knowledge Distillation exploiting dark knowledge from the whole training set.In this framework, we propose a simple and effective implementation named Distillation by Utilizing Peer Samples (DUPS) in one generation.We verify our algorithm on numerous experiments.Compared with standard training on modern architectures, DUPS achieves an average improvement of 1%-2% on various tasks with nearly zero extra cost.Considering some typical Knowledge Distillation methods which are much more time-consuming, we also get comparable or even better performance using DUPS.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.14285713841269856, 0.31578946903047095, 0.13043477837429124, 0.4848484799632691, 0.11764705397923896, 0.095238090793651, 0.05882352456747445, 0.11428570948571448]",HyxfGCVYDr,One Generation Knowledge Distillation by Utilizing Peer Samples,Nous présentons un nouveau cadre de distillation des connaissances qui utilise des échantillons de pairs comme enseignants.

"Designing RNA molecules has garnered recent interest in medicine, synthetic biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics since many functional RNA molecules were shown to be involved in regulatory processes for transcription, epigenetics and translation.Since an RNA's function depends on its structural properties, the RNA Design problem is to find an RNA sequence which satisfies given structural constraints.Here, we propose a new algorithm for the RNA Design problem, dubbed LEARNA.LEARNA uses deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network to sequentially design an entire RNA sequence given a specified target structure.By meta-learning across 65000 different RNA Design tasks for one hour on 20 CPU cores, our extension Meta-LEARNA constructs an RNA Design policy that can be applied out of the box to solve novel RNA Design tasks.Methodologically, for what we believe to be the first time, we jointly optimize over a rich space of architectures for the policy network, the hyperparameters of the training procedure and the formulation of the decision process.Comprehensive empirical results on two widely-used RNA Design benchmarks, as well as a third one that we introduce, show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the former while also being orders of magnitudes faster in reaching the previous state-of-the-art performance.In an ablation study, we analyze the importance of our method's different components.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.13636363173553734, 0.27027026536157783, 0.20689654677764577, 0.22222221728395072, 0.20833332888888897, 0.13953487904813427, 0.11538461112426052, 0.06666666168888927]",ByfyHh05tQ,Learning to Design RNA,Nous apprenons à résoudre le problème de la conception d'ARN avec l'apprentissage par renforcement en utilisant des approches de méta apprentissage et d'autoML.

"Pruning is a popular technique for compressing a neural network: a large pre-trained network is fine-tuned while connections are successively removed.However, the value of pruning has largely evaded scrutiny.In this extended abstract, we examine residual networks obtained through Fisher-pruning and make two interesting observations.First, when time-constrained, it is better to train a simple, smaller network from scratch than prune a large network.Second, it is the architectures obtained through the pruning process  --- not the learnt weights --- that prove valuable.Such architectures are powerful when trained from scratch.Furthermore, these architectures are easy to approximate without any further pruning: we can prune once and obtain a family of new, scalable network architectures for different memory requirements.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.060606055647383326, 0.08333332864583361, 0.06451612403746138, 0.12499999501953145, 0.12903225306971924, 0.08695651720226867, 0.14285713826530627]",r1lbgwFj5m,Pruning neural networks: is it time to nip it in the bud?,"La formation de petits réseaux est plus efficace que l'élagage, mais l'élagage permet de former de bons petits réseaux qui sont faciles à copier."
"Supervised learning problems---particularly those involving social data---are often subjective.That is, human readers, looking at the same data, might come to legitimate but completely different conclusions based on their personal experiences.Yet in machine learning settings feedback from multiple human annotators is often reduced to a single ``ground truth'' label, thus hiding the true, potentially rich and diverse interpretations of the data found across the social spectrum.We explore the rewards and challenges of discovering and learning representative distributions of the labeling opinions of a large human population.A major, critical cost to this approach is the number of humans needed to provide enough labels not only to obtain representative samples but also to train a machine to predict representative distributions on unlabeled data.We propose aggregating label distributions over, not just individuals, but also data items, in order to maximize the costs of humans in the loop.We test different aggregation approaches on state-of-the-art deep learning models.Our results suggest that careful label aggregation methods can greatly reduce the number of samples needed to obtain representative distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.08333332864583361, 0.10810810328707107, 0.20408162840483143, 0.24999999501953132, 0.17391303908317593, 0.27027026544923305, 0.15999999520000013, 0.1714285665306124]",HJlsixKqyQ,Aggregating Crowdsourced Labels in Subjective Domains,Nous étudions le problème de l'apprentissage de la prédiction de la diversité sous-jacente des croyances présentes dans les domaines d'apprentissage supervisé.

"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a family of generative models that do not minimize a single training criterion.Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost.GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players’ parameters.One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium.Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence.We show that this view is overly restrictive.During GAN training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful.We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization.Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail.We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful.This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.24999999501953132, 0.09090908641528948, 0.0, 0.19999999531250012, 0.14999999531250016, 0.173913038941399, 0.2285714236734695, 0.4285714235969388, 0.21052631101108046, 0.285714281122449, 0.3913043434310019]",ByQpn1ZA-,Many Paths to Equilibrium: GANs Do Not Need to Decrease a Divergence At Every Step,Nous trouvons des preuves que la minimisation de la divergence peut ne pas être une caractérisation précise de l'entraînement des GAN.

"Conventional deep reinforcement learning typically determines an appropriate primitive action at each timestep, which requires enormous amount of time and effort for learning an effective policy, especially in large and complex environments.To deal with the issue fundamentally, we incorporate macro actions, defined as sequences of primitive actions, into the primitive action space to form an augmented action space.The problem lies in how to find an appropriate macro action to augment the primitive action space.  The agent using a proper augmented action space is able to jump to a farther state and thus speed up the exploration process as well as facilitate the learning procedure.In previous researches, macro actions are developed by mining the most frequently used action sequences or repeating previous actions.However, the most frequently used action sequences are extracted from a past policy, which may only reinforce the original behavior of that policy.On the other hand, repeating actions may limit the diversity of behaviors of the agent.Instead, we propose to construct macro actions by a genetic algorithm, which eliminates the dependency of the macro action derivation procedure from the past policies of the agent.  Our approach appends a macro action to the primitive action space once at a time and evaluates whether the augmented action space leads to promising performance or not.

"The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn from the surrounding context.Lexical features are fed into the first layer and propagated through a deep network of hidden layers.We argue that the need to represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model’s capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states.We show that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements on standard WMT translation tasks and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the hidden layers.We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments exploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.30769230285338595, 0.12121211621671278, 0.3499999952000001, 0.17142856646530627, 0.16666666172839517, 0.09999999520000023, 0.24390243426531835]",SJgfQH6PQ4,Addressing the Representation Bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation with Lexical Shortcuts,Le fait de doter le modèle de transformation de raccourcis vers la couche d'intégration libère la capacité du modèle pour l'apprentissage de nouvelles informations.

We present NormCo, a deep coherence model which considers the semantics of an entity mention, as well as the topical coherence of the mentions within a single document.NormCo mod-els entity mentions using a simple semantic model which composes phrase representations from word embeddings, and treats coherence as a disease concept co-mention sequence using an RNN rather than modeling the joint probability of all concepts in a document, which requires NP-hard inference.

"Hierarchical Sparse Coding (HSC) is a powerful model to efficiently represent multi-dimensional, structured data such as images.The simplest solution to solve this computationally hard problem is to decompose it into independent layerwise subproblems.However, neuroscientific evidence would suggest inter-connecting these subproblems as in the Predictive Coding (PC) theory, which adds top-down connections between consecutive layers.In this study, a new model called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection.In particular, the SDPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of Lasso layers.A 2-layered SDPC and a Hi-La networks are trained on 3 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer.First, we show that the overall prediction error generated by SDPC is lower thanks to the feedback mechanism as it transfers prediction error between layers.Second, we demonstrate that the inference stage of the SDPC is faster to converge than for the Hi-La model.Third, we show that the SDPC also accelerates the learning process.Finally, the qualitative analysis of both models dictionaries, supported by their activation probability, show that the SDPC features are more generic and informative.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.18749999501953143, 0.0, 0.27027026544923305, 0.21621621139517908, 0.18749999501953143, 0.0, 0.05405404923301723, 0.12499999501953145, 0.07999999520000028, 0.10810810328707107]",rJlcLaVFvB,Effect of top-down connections in Hierarchical Sparse Coding,Cet article démontre de manière expérimentale l'effet bénéfique des connexions descendantes dans l'algorithme de codage spartiate hiérarchique.

"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples.In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear.Here we show that distributions of logit differences have a universal functional form.This functional form is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; nor does it change during training.This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation.We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD).Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness.Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity.To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10.Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.0, 0.07407406908093313, 0.13333332835555575, 0.06451612407908468, 0.1538461499112427, 0.0, 0.0, 0.06249999507812539, 0.06666666168888927]",rk6H0ZbRb,Intriguing Properties of Adversarial Examples,"L'erreur de l'adversaire a une forme de loi de puissance similaire pour tous les ensembles de données et modèles étudiés, et l'architecture a son importance."

"Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells.One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified.The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images.An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation.For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases.In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects).We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information.To do this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment.For the dataset presented, the replicated treatment is the negative control.We find that for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal (2) less domain-specific information is present.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.06451612407908468, 0.05405404934989084, 0.05405404934989084, 0.27586206397146257, 0.08333332920138908, 0.22727272293388434, 0.4117647010380623, 0.1463414589173113, 0.0, 0.24390243452706728]",H18uzzWAZ,Correcting Nuisance Variation using Wasserstein Distance,"Nous corrigeons la variation de la nuisance pour les incorporations d'images dans différents domaines, en ne préservant que les informations pertinentes."

"A typical experiment to study cognitive function is to train animals to perform tasks, while the researcher records the electrical activity of the animals neurons.The main obstacle faced, when using this type of electrophysiological experiment to uncover the circuit mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, is our incomplete access to relevant circuits in the brain.One promising approach is to model neural circuits using an artificial neural network (ANN), which can provide complete access to the “neural circuits” responsible for a behavior.More recently, reinforcement learning models have been adopted to understand the functions of cortico-basal ganglia circuits as reward-based learning has been found in mammalian brain.In this paper, we propose a Biologically-plausible Actor-Critic with Episodic Memory (B-ACEM) framework to model a prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia-hippocampus (PFC-BG) circuit, which is verified to capture the behavioral findings from a well-known perceptual decision-making task, i.e., random dots motion discrimination.This B-ACEM framework links neural computation to behaviors, on which we can explore how episodic memory should be considered to govern future decision.Experiments are conducted using different settings of the episodic memory and results show that all patterns of episodic memories can speed up learning.In particular, salient events are prioritized to propagate reward information and guide decisions.Our B-ACEM framework and the built-on experiments give inspirations to both designs for more standard decision-making models in biological system and a more biologically-plausible ANN.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.04545454071281041, 0.09523809041950139, 0.04999999511250048, 0.24999999577168372, 0.15384614892833676, 0.1578947318975071, 0.0, 0.14999999511250017]",BJl4pA4Kwr,FAST LEARNING VIA EPISODIC MEMORY: A PERSPECTIVE FROM ANIMAL DECISION-MAKING,Apprentissage rapide via la mémoire épisodique vérifié par un cadre biologiquement plausible pour le circuit cortex préfrontal-ganglion basal-hippocampe (PFC-BG)

"In this paper, we find that by designing a novel loss function entitled, ''tracking loss'', Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detectors can be successfully converted to well-performed visual trackers without any extra computational cost.This property is preferable to visual tracking where annotated video sequences for training are always absent, because rich features learned by detectors from still images could be utilized by dynamic trackers.It also avoids extra machinery such as feature engineering and feature aggregation proposed in previous studies.Tracking loss achieves this property by exploiting the internal structure of feature maps within the detection network and treating different feature points discriminatively.Such structure allows us to simultaneously consider discrimination quality and bounding box accuracy which is found to be crucial to the success.We also propose a network compression method to accelerate tracking speed without performance reduction.That also verifies tracking loss will remain highly effective even if the network is drastically compressed.Furthermore, if we employ a carefully designed tracking loss ensemble, the tracker would be much more robust and accurate.Evaluation results show that our trackers (including the ensemble tracker and two baseline trackers), outperform all state-of-the-art methods on VOT 2016 Challenge in terms of Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and robustness.We will make the code publicly available.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.23529411334102268, 0.08695651720226867, 0.0, 0.16216215725346983, 0.11111110617283973, 0.19999999502222232, 0.1249999950000002, 0.22857142360816338, 0.13043477807183385, 0.17391303924385643]",H1lzcXfknm,Tracking Loss: Converting Object Detector to Robust Visual Tracker,Nous avons réussi à convertir un détecteur populaire RPN en un tracker performant du point de vue de la fonction de perte.

"Dreams and our ability to recall them are among the most puzzling questions in sleep research.Specifically, putative differences in brain network dynamics between individuals with high versus low dream recall rates, are still poorly understood.In this study, we addressed this question as a classification problem where we applied deep convolutional networks (CNN) to sleep EEG recordings to predict whether subjects belonged to the high or low dream recall group (HDR and LDR resp.).Our model achieves significant accuracy levels across all the sleep stages, thereby indicating subtle signatures of dream recall in the sleep microstructure.We also visualized the feature space to inspect the subject-specificity of the learned features, thus ensuring that the network captured population level differences.Beyond being the first study to apply deep learning to sleep EEG in order to classify HDR and LDR, guided backpropagation allowed us to visualize the most discriminant features in each sleep stage.The significance of these findings and future directions are discussed.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.17647058325259532, 0.15789473185595584, 0.18518518074074086, 0.21052631080332423, 0.2631578897506926, 0.08888888408888915, 0.14285713826530627]",rJeT47F8Lr,Unravelling the neural signatures of dream recall in EEG: a deep learning approach,"Nous étudions la base neuronale du rappel des rêves à l'aide d'un réseau neuronal convolutif et de techniques de visualisation des caractéristiques, comme le tSNE et la rétropropagation guidée."

"Variational Bayesian Inference is a popular methodology for approximating posterior distributions over Bayesian neural network weights.Recent work developing this class of methods has explored ever richer parameterizations of the approximate posterior in the hope of improving performance.In contrast, here we share a curious experimental finding that suggests instead restricting the variational distribution to a more compact parameterization.For a variety of deep Bayesian neural networks trained using Gaussian mean-field variational inference, we find that the posterior standard deviations consistently exhibit strong low-rank structure after convergence.This means that by decomposing these variational parameters into a low-rank factorization, we can make our variational approximation more compact without decreasing the models' performance.Furthermore, we find that such factorized parameterizations improve the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradient estimates of the variational lower bound, resulting in faster convergence.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.0, 0.04761904266439961, 0.04651162293131476, 0.03921568132256887, 0.12765956947034876, 0.13333332833580264]",SJezFk2VYH,The k-tied Normal Distribution: A Compact Parameterization of Gaussian Mean Field Posteriors in Bayesian Neural Networks,"Le champ moyen VB utilise deux fois plus de paramètres ; nous lions les paramètres de variance dans le champ moyen VB sans aucune perte dans ELBO, en gagnant de la vitesse et des gradients de variance plus faibles."

While directly applying probability constraint is not effective, users need to provide additional very weak supervisions: mark some batches that have output distribution greatly differ from target probability distribution.We use experiments to empirically prove that our model can converge to an accuracy higher than other state-of-art semi-supervised learning models with less high quality labeled training examples.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.07407406908093313, 0.105263153393352, 0.21428570931122462, 0.43243242787436087, 0.1999999956125001, 0.14999999561250013]",r1esys0Nd4,Train Neural Network by Embedding Space Probabilistic Constraint ,"Cet article intègre la distribution des étiquettes dans l'apprentissage des modèles lorsqu'un nombre limité d'instances d'apprentissage est disponible, et propose deux techniques pour traiter le problème de la distribution des étiquettes de sortie qui est faussement biaisée."

"Models of code can learn distributed representations of a program's syntax and semantics to predict many non-trivial properties of a program.Recent state-of-the-art models leverage highly structured representations of programs, such as trees, graphs and paths therein (e.g. data-flow relations), which are precise and abundantly available for code.This provides a strong inductive bias towards semantically meaningful relations, yielding more generalizable representations than classical sequence-based models.Unfortunately, these models primarily rely on graph-based message passing to represent relations in code, which makes them de facto local due to the high cost of message-passing steps, quite in contrast to modern, global sequence-based models, such as the Transformer.In this work, we bridge this divide between global and structured models by introducing two new hybrid model families that are both global and incorporate structural bias: Graph Sandwiches, which wrap traditional (gated) graph message-passing layers in sequential message-passing layers; and Graph Relational Embedding Attention Transformers (GREAT for short), which bias traditional Transformers with relational information from graph edge types.By studying a popular, non-trivial program repair task, variable-misuse identification, we explore the relative merits of traditional and hybrid model families for code representation.Starting with a  graph-based model that already improves upon the prior state-of-the-art for this task by 20%, we show that our proposed hybrid models improve an additional 10-15%, while training both faster and using fewer parameters.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.36363635867768596, 0.19047618588435386, 0.12121211625344373, 0.07843136839677069, 0.12307691952662732, 0.1538461491124262, 0.07999999580000022]",B1lnbRNtwr,Global Relational Models of Source Code,Les modèles de code source qui combinent des caractéristiques globales et structurelles apprennent des représentations plus puissantes des programmes.

"Importance sampling (IS) is a standard Monte Carlo (MC) tool to compute information about random variables such as moments or quantiles with unknown distributions.  IS is asymptotically consistent as the number of MC samples, and hence deltas (particles) that parameterize the density estimate, go to infinity.However, retaining infinitely many particles is intractable.We propose a scheme for only keeping a \emph{finite representative subset} of particles and their augmented importance weights that is \emph{nearly consistent}. To do so in {an online manner}, we approximate importance sampling in two ways.  First, we replace the deltas by kernels, yielding kernel density estimates (KDEs).  Second, we sequentially project KDEs onto nearby lower-dimensional subspaces.We characterize the asymptotic bias of this scheme as determined by a compression parameter and kernel bandwidth, which yields a tunable tradeoff between consistency and memory.In experiments,  we observe a favorable tradeoff between memory and accuracy, providing for the first time near-consistent compressions of arbitrary posterior distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.11764705493079598, 0.0, 0.0, 0.18604650831800976, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1212121172451792, 0.06451612491155072]",H1lSFJ34FH, A Projection Operator to Balance Consistency and Complexity in Importance Sampling,Nous avons proposé un nouvel algorithme d'échantillonnage par importance compressé à noyau.

"Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) can be used to improve classical CNNs by equipping them with the geometric structure of groups.Central in the success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory.Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory).In this paper we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups.In our approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra.This leads to a flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline expansions.The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCam dataset) in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset) in which scale equivariance is important.In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.20512820015779104, 0.15094339174083315, 0.1777777729777779, 0.3076923027218935, 0.23809523319727902, 0.2926829219036289, 0.11764705425605555, 0.04878048287923905]",H1gBhkBFDH,B-Spline CNNs on Lie groups,L'article décrit un cadre flexible pour construire des CNN qui sont équivoques pour une grande classe de groupes de transformations.

" Global feature pooling is a modern variant of feature pooling providing better interpretatability and regularization.Although alternative pooling methods exist (eg. max, lp norm, stochastic), the averaging operation is still the dominating global pooling scheme in popular models.As fine-grained recognition requires learning subtle, discriminative features, we consider the question: is average pooling the optimal strategy?We first ask: ``is there a difference between features learned by global average and max pooling?''

"Now GANs can generate more and more realistic face images that can easily fool human beings.  In contrast, a common convolutional neural network(CNN), e.g. ResNet-18, can achieve more than 99.9% accuracy in discerning fake/real faces if training and testing faces are from the same source.In this paper, we performed both human studies and CNN experiments, which led us to two important findings.One finding is that the textures of fake faces are substantially different from real ones.CNNs can capture local image texture information for recognizing fake/real face, while such cues are easily overlooked by humans.The other finding is that global image texture information is more robust to image editing and generalizable to fake faces from different GANs and datasets.Based on the above findings, we propose  a  novel  architecture  coined  as  Gram-Net,  which  incorporates  “Gram Block” in multiple semantic levels to extract global image texture representations.Experimental results demonstrate that our Gram-Net performs better than existing approaches for fake face detection.

"The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community.Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes.The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling, and most recently in reinforcement learning.In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients.The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third.We provide empirical evidence suggesting this is a serious issue in practice.Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cramér distance.We show that the Cramér distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences.We give empirical results on a number of domains comparing these three divergences.To illustrate the practical relevance of the Cramér distance we design a new algorithm, the Cramér Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it has a number of desirable properties over the related Wasserstein GAN.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.16666666205246927, 0.09999999511250024, 0.13043477760869585, 0.04081632154935504, 0.1538461490072322, 0.05714285263673504, 0.21052631101108046, 0.19512194629387283, 0.0, 0.15094339131363493]",S1m6h21Cb,The Cramer Distance as a Solution to Biased Wasserstein Gradients,"La distance de Wasserstein est difficile à minimiser avec la descente de gradient stochastique, alors que la distance de Cramer peut être optimisée facilement et fonctionne tout aussi bien."

"Data augmentation (DA) has been widely utilized to improve generalization in training deep neural networks.Recently, human-designed data augmentation has been gradually replaced by automatically learned augmentation policy.Through finding the best policy in well-designed search space of data augmentation, AutoAugment (Cubuk et al., 2019) can significantly improve validation accuracy on image classification tasks.However, this approach is not computationally practical for large-scale problems.In this paper, we develop an adversarial method to arrive at a computationally-affordable solution called Adversarial AutoAugment, which can simultaneously optimize target related object and augmentation policy search loss.The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training loss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies, while the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to improve the generalization.In contrast to prior work, we reuse the computation in target network training for policy evaluation, and dispense with the retraining of the target network.Compared to AutoAugment, this leads to about 12x reduction in computing cost and 11x shortening in time overhead on ImageNet.We show experimental results of our approach on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art.On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 test error of 1.36%, which is the currently best performing single model.On ImageNet, we achieve a leading performance of top-1 accuracy 79.40% on ResNet-50 and 80.00% on ResNet-50-D without extra data.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.24999999501953132, 0.13793102963139137, 0.1818181770764464, 0.0, 0.17391303881852566, 0.39999999529876545, 0.21052631084487544, 0.05714285214693921, 0.11764705382352963, 0.16666666168209893, 0.1578947318975071]",ByxdUySKvS,Adversarial AutoAugment,Nous introduisons l'idée de l'apprentissage contradictoire dans l'augmentation automatique des données pour améliorer la généralisation d'un réseau de targe.

"As the basic building block of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the convolutional layer is designed to extract local patterns and lacks the ability to model global context in its nature.Many efforts have been recently made to complement CNNs with the global modeling ability, especially by a family of works on global feature interaction.In these works, the global context information is incorporated into local features before they are fed into convolutional layers.However, research on neuroscience reveals that, besides influences changing the inputs to our neurons, the neurons' ability of modifying their functions dynamically according to context is essential for perceptual tasks, which has been overlooked in most of CNNs.Motivated by this, we propose one novel Context-Gated Convolution (CGC) to explicitly modify the weights of convolutional layers adaptively under the guidance of global context.As such, being aware of the global context, the modulated convolution kernel of our proposed CGC can better extract representative local patterns and compose discriminative features.Moreover, our proposed CGC is lightweight, amenable to modern CNN architectures, and consistently improves the performance of CNNs according to extensive experiments on image classification, action recognition, and machine translation.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]","[0.22641508934140273, 0.12244897461057913, 0.2727272678925621, 0.09836065084654688, 0.285714280733028, 0.359999995008, 0.07407406908093313]",B1lFkRNKDS,Context-Gated Convolution,"Une nouvelle convolution contextuelle qui incorpore des informations contextuelles globales dans les CNN en modulant explicitement les noyaux de convolution, et capture ainsi des modèles locaux plus représentatifs et extrait des caractéristiques discriminantes."

"Batch Normalization (BN) is one of the most widely used techniques in Deep Learning field.But its performance can awfully degrade with insufficient batch size.This weakness limits the usage of BN on many computer vision tasks like detection or segmentation, where batch size is usually small due to the constraint of memory consumption.Therefore many modified normalization techniques have been proposed, which either fail to restore the performance of BN completely, or have to introduce additional nonlinear operations in inference procedure and increase huge consumption.In this paper, we reveal that there are two extra batch statistics involved in backward propagation of BN, on which has never been well discussed before.The extra batch statistics associated with gradients also can severely affect the training of deep neural network.Based on our analysis, we propose a novel normalization method, named Moving Average Batch Normalization (MABN).MABN can completely restore the performance of vanilla BN in small batch cases, without introducing any additional nonlinear operations in inference procedure.We prove the benefits of MABN by both theoretical analysis and experiments.Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MABN in multiple computer vision tasks including ImageNet and COCO.The code has been released in https://github.com/megvii-model/MABN.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.18181817685950424, 0.2051282008678502, 0.09523809115646274, 0.05263157462603914, 0.06896551239001224, 0.2857142808163266, 0.12121211658402223, 0.08333332833333364, 0.0, 0.0]",SkgGjRVKDS,Towards Stabilizing Batch Statistics in Backward Propagation of Batch Normalization,Nous proposons une nouvelle méthode de normalisation pour traiter les cas de petites tailles de lots.

"Deep latent variable models have become a popular model choice due to the scalable learning algorithms introduced by (Kingma & Welling 2013, Rezende et al. 2014).These approaches maximize a variational lower bound on the intractable log likelihood of the observed data.Burda et al.

"When training a deep neural network for supervised image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification of class Y. Following the notation of Gong et al. (2016), we can divide features broadly into the classes of(i) “core” or “conditionally invariant” features X^ci whose distribution P(X^ci | Y) does not change substantially across domains and(ii) “style” or “orthogonal” features X^orth whose distribution P(X^orth | Y) can change substantially across domains.These latter orthogonal features would generally include features such as position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color or posture for images of persons.We try to guard against future adversarial domain shifts by ideally just using the “conditionally invariant” features for classification.In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable.We can hence not directly see the distributional change of features across different domains. We do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable.We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person.In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image.The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.We provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al. (2016).However, we are interested in settings where we cannot observe the domain directly and we treat domain as a latent variable.If two or more samples share the same class and identifier, (Y, ID)=(y,i), then we treat those samples as counterfactuals under different style interventions on the orthogonal or style features.Using this grouping-by-ID approach, we regularize the network to provide near constant output across samples that share the same ID by penalizing with an appropriate graph Laplacian.This is shown to substantially improve performance in settings where domains change in terms of image quality, brightness, color changes, and more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture.We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness and transfer learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.13793102996432832, 0.051282046285339083, 0.05555555061728439, 0.08333332847222251, 0.4102564052596976, 0.20512820013149255, 0.1714285665306124, 0.05714285224489839, 0.2564102514135438, 0.15789473185595584, 0.1714285665306124, 0.20512820013149255, 0.21052631080332423, 0.043478255954631936, 0.08695651682419688, 0.12765956957899524, 0.19354838251821027]",HyPpD0g0Z,Grouping-By-ID: Guarding Against Adversarial Domain Shifts,"Nous proposons une régularisation contrefactuelle pour se prémunir contre les changements de domaine adverses résultant de changements dans la distribution des ""caractéristiques de style"" latentes des images."

"Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms require several steps of gradient descent to adapt to newly incoming tasks.This process becomes more costly as the number  of  samples  increases.  Moreover,  the  gradient  updates  suffer  from  several sources of noise leading to a degraded performance.   In this work,  we propose a meta-learning algorithm equipped with the GradiEnt Component COrrections, aGECCO cell for short, which generates a multiplicative corrective low-rank matrix which (after vectorization) corrects the estimated gradients. GECCO contains a simple decoder-like network with learnable parameters, an attention module and a so-called context input parameter. The context parameter of GECCO is updated to  generate  a  low-rank  corrective  term  for  the  network  gradients.   As  a  result, meta-learning requires only a few of gradient updates to absorb new task (often, a single update is sufficient in the few-shot scenario). While previous approaches address this problem by altering the learning rates, factorising network parameters or directly learning feature corrections from features and/or gradients, GECCO is an off-the-shelf generator-like unit that performs element-wise gradient corrections without the need to ‘observe’ the features and/or the gradients directly.

"Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for many applications of interest.Unfortunately they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs.Moreover, the perturbations can transfer across models: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead other unseen models.Consequently  the adversary can leverage it to attack against the deployed black-box systems.

"Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information.Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data:1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing.In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels.We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors.Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction.Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data.Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets.Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance.Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.24242423746556482, 0.16216215734112505, 0.1481481432098767, 0.071428566454082, 0.3124999950195313, 0.4117647009515571, 0.1714285665306124, 0.13333332833333353, 0.33333332847222225, 0.11428570938775531, 0.3448275812128419]",rygqqsA9KX,Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations,"Nous proposons un modèle pour apprendre des représentations multimodales factorisées qui sont discriminantes, génératives et interprétables."

"Existing neural networks are vulnerable to ""adversarial examples""---created by adding maliciously designed small perturbations in inputs to induce a misclassification by the networks.The most investigated defense strategy is adversarial training which augments training data with adversarial examples.However, applying single-step adversaries in adversarial training does not support the robustness of the networks, instead, they will even make the networks to be overfitted.In contrast to the single-step, multi-step training results in the state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and CIFAR10, yet it needs a massive amount of time.Therefore, we propose a method, Stochastic Quantized Activation (SQA) that solves overfitting problems in single-step adversarial training and fastly achieves the robustness comparable to the multi-step.SQA attenuates the adversarial effects by providing random selectivity to activation functions and allows the network to learn robustness with only single-step training.Throughout the experiment, our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art robustness against one of the strongest white-box attacks as PGD training, but with much less computational cost.Finally, we visualize the learning process of the network with SQA to handle strong adversaries, which is different from existing methods.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]","[0.14285713786848087, 0.11428570961632674, 0.26666666166913583, 0.26666666166913583, 0.7659574418288819, 0.27906976244456466, 0.08888888389135831, 0.09523809024943337]",ryxeB30cYX,Stochastic Quantized Activation: To prevent Overfitting in Fast Adversarial Training,Cet article propose l'activation quantifiée stochastique qui résout les problèmes de surajustement dans la formation adverse FGSM et atteint rapidement une robustesse comparable à la formation en plusieurs étapes.

"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used in state-of-the-art models in domains such as speech recognition, machine translation, and language modelling.Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models.Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors.Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms.In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization with pruning to create blocks of weights with zeros.Using these techniques, we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with a small loss in accuracy.This technique allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x.Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the overall parameter count.Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up to 32x32.Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to unstructured sparsity.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.0, 0.05882352456747445, 0.1874999953125001, 0.26086956030245756, 0.15999999520000013, 0.19999999500000015, 0.12499999531250018, 0.22222221728395072, 0.12499999531250018, 0.19999999500000015]",HJaDJZ-0W,Block-Sparse Recurrent Neural Networks,"Nous montrons que les RNN peuvent être élagués pour induire la sparsité des blocs, ce qui améliore la vitesse des opérations à faible densité sur le matériel existant."

"We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually.Our key idea is that a good guiding principle for intrinsic motivation in synergistic tasks is to take actions which affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if the agents were acting on their own.Thus, we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot be predicted via a composition of the predicted effect for each individual agent.We study two instantiations of this idea, one based on the true states encountered, and another based on a dynamics model trained concurrently with the policy.While the former is simpler, the latter has the benefit of being analytically differentiable with respect to the action taken.We validate our approach in robotic bimanual manipulation tasks with sparse rewards; we find that our approach yields more efficient learning than both1) training with only the sparse reward and2) using the typical surprise-based formulation of intrinsic motivation, which does not bias toward synergistic behavior.Videos are available on the project webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/iclr2020-synergistic.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.5352112626066258, 0.5714285664326532, 0.2333333285333334, 0.13559321558172954, 0.15094339186899264, 0.10526315324099744, 0.045454542479339034, 0.26923076497041426, 0.04347825746691899]",SJleNCNtDH,Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior,"Nous proposons une formulation de la motivation intrinsèque qui convient comme biais d'exploration dans les tâches synergiques multi-agents à récompense éparse, en encourageant les agents à affecter le monde d'une manière qui ne serait pas atteinte s'ils agissaient individuellement."

"Learning multilingual representations of text has proven a successful method for many cross-lingual transfer learning tasks.There are two main paradigms for learning such representations: (1) alignment, which maps different independently trained monolingual representations into a shared space, and (2) joint training, which directly learns unified multilingual representations using monolingual and cross-lingual objectives jointly.In this paper, we first conduct direct comparisons of representations learned using both of these methods across diverse cross-lingual tasks.Our empirical results reveal a set of pros and cons for both methods, and show that the relative performance of alignment versus joint training is task-dependent.Stemming from this analysis, we propose a simple and novel framework that combines these two previously mutually-exclusive approaches.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that our proposed framework alleviates limitations of both approaches, and outperforms existing methods on the MUSE bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) benchmark.We further show that our proposed framework can generalize to contextualized representations and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL cross-lingual NER benchmark.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0.1538461490072322, 0.21052631097568494, 0.23809523314058967, 0.25531914393843375, 0.2926829219036289, 0.1632653011411913, 0.17777777278024703]",S1l-C0NtwS,Cross-lingual Alignment vs Joint Training: A Comparative Study and A Simple Unified Framework,Nous menons une étude comparative de l'alignement interlinguistique et des méthodes d'apprentissage conjointes et nous unifions ces deux paradigmes auparavant exclusifs dans un nouveau cadre.

"There has been recent interest in improving performance of simple models for multiple reasons such as interpretability, robust learning from small data, deployment in memory constrained settings as well as environmental considerations.In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance.Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel.Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network, which was one of the main ideas in previous work \citep{profweight}, to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method.The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases.In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance.We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works.Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.1499999960125001, 0.24999999684311228, 0.1538461497961868, 0.08888888519506187, 0.09523809137188224, 0.23999999507200007, 0.07692307204142042, 0.2499999954882813]",HyxQbaEYPr,Leveraging Simple Model Predictions for Enhancing its Performance,Méthode permettant d'améliorer les performances des modèles simples à partir d'un modèle complexe (précis).

"Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.In relation to the structure of the landscape, we study the permutation symmetry of neurons in each layer of a deep neural network, which gives rise not only to multiple equivalent global minima of the loss function but also to critical points in between partner minima.In a network of $d-1$ hidden layers with $n_k$ neurons in layers $k = 1, \ldots, d$, we construct continuous paths between equivalent global minima that lead through a `permutation point' where the input and output weight vectors of two neurons in the same hidden layer $k$ collide and interchange.We show that such permutation points are critical points which lie inside high-dimensional subspaces of equal loss, contributing to the global flatness of the landscape.We also find that a permutation point for the exchange of neurons $i$ and $j$ transits into a flat high-dimensional plateau that enables all $n_k!$permutations of neurons in a given layer $k$ at the same loss value. Moreover, we introduce higher-order permutation points by exploiting the hierarchical structure in the loss landscapes of neural networks, and find that the number of $K$-th order permutation points is much larger than the (already huge) number of equivalent global minima -- at least by a polynomial factor of order $K$.

"Network pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing the size of deep neural networks.Pruning uncovers high-performance subnetworks by taking a trained dense network and gradually removing unimportant connections.Recently, alternative techniques have emerged for training sparse networks directly without having to train a large dense model beforehand, thereby achieving small memory footprints during both training and inference.These techniques are based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters during training.Thus, they are in effect executing a training-time search for the optimal subnetwork.We investigate a most recent one of these techniques and conduct additional experiments to elucidate its behavior in training sparse deep convolutional networks.Dynamic parameter reallocation converges early during training to a highly trainable subnetwork.We show that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the discovered high-performance subnetwork is sufficient to explain its good performance.Rather, it is the dynamics of parameter reallocation that are responsible for successful learning.Dynamic parameter reallocation thus improves the trainability of deep convolutional networks, playing a similar role as overparameterization, without incurring the memory and computational cost of the latter.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0.09999999520000023, 0.10256409783037496, 0.13114753621069625, 0.10810810355003672, 0.17021276095971044, 0.11111110666666683, 0.09302325088155787, 0.2105263111357342, 0.24999999500000009]",BygIWTMdjX,Dynamic parameter reallocation improves trainability of deep convolutional networks,"La réaffectation dynamique des paramètres permet de réussir l'apprentissage direct de réseaux compacts et épars, et joue un rôle indispensable même lorsque nous connaissons a priori le réseau épars optimal."

"The softmax function is widely used to train deep neural networks for multi-class classification.Despite its outstanding performance in classification tasks, the features derived from the supervision of softmax are usually sub-optimal in some scenarios where Euclidean distances apply in feature spaces.To address this issue, we propose a new loss, dubbed the isotropic loss, in the sense that the overall distribution of data points is regularized to approach the isotropic normal one.Combined with the vanilla softmax, we formalize a novel criterion called the isotropic softmax, or isomax for short, for supervised learning of deep neural networks.By virtue of the isomax, the intra-class features are penalized by the isotropic loss while inter-class distances are well kept by the original softmax loss.Moreover, the isomax loss does not require any additional modifications to the network, mini-batches or the training process.Extensive experiments on classification and clustering are performed to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the isomax loss.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0.2222222174691359, 0.1276595694884565, 0.24999999503472223, 0.18181817681818196, 0.1951219462462821, 0.0, 0.1052631530193908]",rkgINf1G1m,Softmax Supervision with Isotropic Normalization,La capacité discriminative de softmax pour l'apprentissage des vecteurs de caractéristiques des objets est efficacement améliorée par la virture de la normalisation isotrope sur la distribution globale des points de données.
