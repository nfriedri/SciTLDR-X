"Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs.MPT is typically used in combination with a technique called loss scaling, that works by scaling up the loss value up before the start of backpropagation in order to minimize the impact of numerical underflow on training.Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages.We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter.We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods.We present experimental results on a variety of networks and tasks that show our approach can shorten the time to convergence and improve accuracy, compared with using the existing state-of-the-art MPT and single-precision floating point.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],rJlnfaNYvB,Adaptive Loss Scaling for Mixed Precision Training,﻿Ideamos un escalado de pérdidas adaptativo para mejorar el entrenamiento de precisión mixta que supera los resultados del estado del arte.

"Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging due to their large size and complexity.Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models.However, these studies usually do not consider the changes in the loss function when performing quantization, nor do they take the different importances of DNN model parameters to the accuracy into account.We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each network parameter such that the increase in loss is minimized.The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each parameter and assigns it a precision accordingly.Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution.Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rates.Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],SyOK1Sg0W,Adaptive Quantization of Neural Networks,Un método adaptativo para la cuantificación en punto fijo de redes neuronales basado en el análisis teórico y no en la heurística.

"Universal probabilistic programming systems (PPSs) provide a powerful framework for specifying rich and complex probabilistic models.However, this expressiveness comes at the cost of substantially complicating the process of drawing inferences from the model.In particular, inference can become challenging when the support of the model varies between executions.Though general-purpose inference engines have been designed to operate in such settings, they are typically inefficient, often relying on proposing from the prior to make transitions.To address this, we introduce a new inference framework: Divide, Conquer, and Combine (DCC).DCC divides the program into separate straight-line sub-programs, each of which has a fixed support allowing more powerful inference algorithms to be run locally, before recombining their outputs in a principled fashion.We show how DCC can be implemented as an automated and general-purpose PPS inference engine, and empirically confirm that it can provide substantial performance improvements over previous approaches.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],Syx2tJnNtr,"Divide, Conquer, and Combine: a New Inference Strategy for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support","Divide, Conquista y Combina es un nuevo esquema de inferencia que se puede realizar sobre los programas probabilísticos con soporte estocástico, es decir, la propia existencia de las variables es estocástica."
"Detecting communities or the modular structure of real-life networks (e.g. a socialnetwork or a product purchase network) is an important task because the way anetwork functions is often determined by its communities.The traditional approaches to community detection involve modularity-based approaches,which generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics thatseek to maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those betweenthem.Node embedding approaches, which represent each node in a graph as areal-valued vector, transform the problem of community detection in a graph tothat of clustering a set of vectors.Existing node embedding approaches are primarilybased on first initiating uniform random walks from each node to constructa context of a node and then seeks to make the vector representation ofthe node close to its context.However, standard node embedding approaches donot directly take into account the community structure of a network while constructingthe context around each node.To alleviate this, we explore two differentthreads of work.First, we investigate the use of biased random walks (specifically,maximum entropy based walks) to obtain more centrality preserving embeddingof nodes, which we hypothesize may lead to more effective clusters in the embeddedspace.Second, we propose a community structure aware node embeddingapproach where we incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics intothe objective function of node embedding.We demonstrate that our proposed approachfor community detection outperforms a number of modularity-based baselinesas well as K-means on a standard node-embedded vector space (specifically,node2vec) on a wide range of real-life networks of different sizes and densities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1gQY64FwB,COMMUNITY PRESERVING NODE EMBEDDING,Un algoritmo de incrustación de nodos que preserva la comunidad y que da como resultado una detección más eficaz de las comunidades con una agrupación en el espacio incrustado

This setting corresponds to that which human learners face as they acquire domain expertise, for example, as an individual reads a textbook chapter-by-chapter.Through simulations involving sequences of 10 related tasks, we find reason for optimism that nets will scale well as they advance from having a single skill to becoming domain experts.We observed two key phenomena.First, forward facilitation---the accelerated learning of task n+1 having learned n previous tasks---grows with n. Second, backward interference---the forgetting of the n previous tasks when learning task n+1---diminishes with n.  Forward facilitation is the goal of research on metalearning, and reduced backward interference is the goal of research on ameliorating catastrophic forgetting.We find that both of these goals are attained simply through broader exposure to a domain.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],Bygi-YNNC4,Scaling characteristics of sequential multitask learning: Networks naturally learn to learn,"Estudiamos el comportamiento de una CNN a medida que domina nuevas tareas, a la vez que preserva el dominio de las tareas previamente aprendidas"

"Over the last few years exciting work in deep generative models has produced models able to suggest new organic molecules by generating strings, trees, and graphs representing their structure.While such models are able to generate molecules with desirable properties, their utility in practice is limited due to the difficulty in knowing how to synthesize these molecules.We therefore propose a new molecule generation model, mirroring a more realistic real-world process, where reactants are selected and combined to form more complex molecules.More specifically, our generative model proposes a bag of initial reactants (selected from a pool of commercially-available molecules) and uses a reaction model to predict how they react together to generate new molecules.Modeling the entire process of constructing a molecule during generation offers a number of advantages.First, we show that such a model has the ability to generate a wide, diverse set of valid and unique molecules due to the useful inductive biases of modeling reactions.Second, modeling synthesis routes rather than final molecules offers practical advantages to chemists who are not only interested in new molecules but also suggestions on stable and safe synthetic routes.Third, we demonstrate the capabilities of our model to also solve one-step retrosynthesis problems, predicting a set of reactants that can produce a target product.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJlQEILY_N,Generating Molecules via Chemical Reactions,Un modelo generativo profundo para moléculas orgánicas que primero genera bloques de construcción de reactivos antes de combinarlos utilizando un predictor de reacciones.

"The phase problem in diffraction physics is one of the oldest inverse problems in all of science.The central difficulty that any approach to solving this inverse problem must overcome is that half of the information, namely the phase of the diffracted beam, is always missing.In the context of electron microscopy, the phase problem is generally non-linear and solutions provided by phase-retrieval techniques are known to be poor approximations to the physics of electrons interacting with matter.Here, we show that a semi-supervised learning approach can effectively solve the phase problem in electron microscopy/scattering.In particular, we introduce a new Deep Neural Network (DNN), Y-net, which simultaneously learns a reconstruction algorithm via supervised training in addition to learning a physics-based regularization via unsupervised training.We demonstrate that this constrained, semi-supervised approach is an order of magnitude more data-efficient and accurate than the same model trained in a purely supervised fashion.In addition, the architecture of the Y-net model provides for a straightforward evaluation of the consistency of the model's prediction during inference and is generally applicable to the phase problem in other settings.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],Bygi2739Lr,Y-net: A Physics-constrained and Semi-supervised Learning Approach to the Phase Problem in Computational Electron Imaging,Introducimos una red neuronal profunda semi-supervisada para aproximar la solución del problema de fase en microscopía electrónica

"Most classification and segmentation datasets assume a closed-world scenario in which predictions are expressed as distribution over a predetermined set of visual classes.However, such assumption implies unavoidable and often unnoticeable failures in presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) input.These failures are bound to happen in most real-life applications since current visual ontologies are far from being comprehensive.We propose to address this issue by discriminative detection of OOD pixels in input data.Different from recent approaches, we avoid to bring any decisions by only observing the training dataset of the primary model trained to solve the desired computer vision task.Instead, we train a dedicated OOD modelwhich discriminates the primary training set from a much larger ""background"" dataset which approximates the variety of the visual world.We perform our experiments on high resolution natural images in a dense prediction setup.We use several road driving datasets as our training distribution, while we approximate the background distribution with the ILSVRC dataset.We evaluate our approach on WildDash test, which is currently the only public test dataset with out-of-distribution images.The obtained results show that the proposed approach succeeds to identify out-of-distribution pixels while outperforming previous work by a wide margin.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],H1x1noAqKX,Discriminative out-of-distribution detection for semantic segmentation,Presentamos un enfoque novedoso para detectar los píxeles fuera de distribución en la segmentación semántica.

"Network quantization is one of the most hardware friendly techniques to enable the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on low-power mobile devices.Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy, since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have different amounts of redundancy.The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN) directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead.To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs.However, prior works use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN, because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too large.The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results.It is difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) DDPG-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can achieve reasonable inference accuracy.In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for each activation layer.Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the inference latency by 54.06%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by 50.69%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygfnn4twS,AutoQ: Automated Kernel-Wise Neural Network Quantization ,"Cuantización precisa, rápida y automatizada de redes neuronales con precisión mixta utilizando el aprendizaje profundo por refuerzo jerárquico"

"We present Newtonian Monte Carlo (NMC), a method to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence by analyzing the first and second order gradients of the target density to determine a suitable proposal density at each point.Existing first order gradient-based methods suffer from the problem of determining an appropriate step size.Too small a step size and it will take a large number of steps to converge, while a very large step size will cause it to overshoot the high density region.NMC is similar to the Newton-Raphson update in optimization where the second order gradient is used to automatically scale the step size in each dimension.However, our objective is not to find a maxima but instead to find a parameterized density that can best match the local curvature of the target density.  This parameterized density is then used as a single-site Metropolis-Hastings proposal.As a further improvement on first order methods, we show that random variables with constrained supports don't need to be transformed before taking a gradient step.NMC directly matches constrained random variables to a proposal density with the same support thus keeping the curvature of the target density intact.We demonstrate the efficiency of NMC on a number of different domains.For statistical models where the prior is conjugate to the likelihood, our method recovers the posterior quite trivially in one step.However, we also show results on fairly large non-conjugate models, where NMC performs better than adaptive first order methods such as NUTS or other inexact scalable inference methods such as Stochastic Variational Inference or bootstrapping.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]",[],SklKcJ3EFH,Newtonian Monte Carlo: a second-order gradient method for speeding up MCMC,Explotar la curvatura para que los métodos MCMC converjan más rápido que el estado del arte.

"Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself.These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values.However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among \textit{(domain, slot)} pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns.In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots.In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level.Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],H1e_cC4twS,Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking,"Proponemos el primer modelo neuronal no autorregresivo para el seguimiento del estado del diálogo (DST), logrando la precisión SOTA (49,04%) en el benchmark MultiWOZ2.1, y reduciendo la latencia de la inferencia en un orden de magnitud."

"The 3D-zoom operation is the positive translation of the camera in the Z-axis, perpendicular to the image plane.In contrast, the optical zoom changes the focal length and the digital zoom is used to enlarge a certain region of an image to the original image size.In this paper, we are the first to formulate an unsupervised 3D-zoom learning problem where images with an arbitrary zoom factor can be generated from a given single image.An unsupervised framework is convenient, as it is a challenging task to obtain a 3D-zoom dataset of natural scenes due to the need for special equipment to ensure camera movement is restricted to the Z-axis.Besides, the objects in the scenes should not move when being captured, which hinders the construction of a large dataset of outdoor scenes.We present a novel unsupervised framework to learn how to generate arbitrarily 3D-zoomed versions of a single image, not requiring a 3D-zoom ground truth, called the Deep 3D-Zoom Net.The Deep 3D-Zoom Net incorporates the following features:(i) transfer learning from a pre-trained disparity estimation network via a back re-projection reconstruction loss;(ii) a fully convolutional network architecture that models depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), taking into account high-frequency details without the need for estimating the intermediate disparity; and(iii) incorporating a discriminator network that acts as a no-reference penalty for unnaturally rendered areas.Even though there is no baseline to fairly compare our results, our method outperforms previous novel view synthesis research in terms of realistic appearance on large camera baselines.We performed extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HylohJrKPS,Deep 3D-Zoom Net: Unsupervised Learning of Photo-Realistic 3D-Zoom,Una novedosa arquitectura de red para realizar Zoom 3D profundo o primeros planos.

"Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture.In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely  Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut.This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels.We solve it by introducing  edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search.Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability.Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.Our code has been made available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/on9lg3rpx1r6dkf/AABG5mt0sMHjnEJyoRnLEYW4a?dl=0.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJlS634tPr,PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search,Permitir la conexión parcial de canales en superredes para regularizar y acelerar la búsqueda de arquitecturas diferenciables

"Variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are approximate posterior inference algorithms that are often said to have complementary strengths, with VI being fast but biased and MCMC being slower but asymptotically unbiased.In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think.In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow.This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to too few warmup steps) may track that of VI (due to too few optimization steps), up to differences due to VI’s parameterization and asymptotic bias.Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and momentum-accelerated versions) do evolve similarly.This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it’s far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJggcy2NFS,Langevin Dynamics as Nonparametric Variational Inference,"El comportamiento transitorio de los algoritmos MCMC basados en el gradiente y la inferencia variacional es más similar de lo que se podría pensar, lo que pone en duda la afirmación de que la inferencia variacional es más rápida que MCMC."

"Image translation between two domains is a class of problems aiming to learn mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the target domain.It has been applied to numerous applications, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training.When paired training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed problem.We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term.We further notice that existing image translation techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce unwanted changes or artifacts to the input.Thus we propose to add an attention module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process.The module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes.The predicted attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection.Extensive experiments and evaluations show that our model while being simpler, achieves significantly better performance than existing image translation methods.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygypo0qtm,"Show, Attend and Translate: Unsupervised Image Translation with Self-Regularization and Attention",Proponemos un modelo generativo simple para la traducción de imágenes sin supervisión y la detección de saliencia.
"Building deep neural networks to control autonomous agents which have to interact in real-time with the physical world, such as robots or automotive vehicles, requires a seamless integration of time into a network’s architecture.The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components.Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units.For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner.In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel.In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases.These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing.Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections.We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity.We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks.Additionally, we provide a toolbox to design, train, evaluate, and online-interact with layerwise-parallel networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],SkfNU2e0Z,Statestream: A toolbox to explore layerwise-parallel deep neural networks,"Definimos un concepto de redes neuronales profundas paralelas al modelo de capas, para las que las capas operan en paralelo, y proporcionamos una caja de herramientas para diseñar, entrenar, evaluar e interactuar en línea con estas redes."

"Developing effective biologically plausible learning rules for deep neural networks is important for advancing connections between deep learning and neuroscience.To date, local synaptic learning rules like those employed by the brain have failed to match the performance of backpropagation in deep networks.In this work, we employ meta-learning to discover networks that learn using feedback connections and local, biologically motivated learning rules.Importantly, the feedback connections are not tied to the feedforward weights, avoiding any biologically implausible weight transport.It can be shown mathematically that this approach has sufficient expressivity to approximate any online learning algorithm.Our experiments show that the meta-trained networks effectively use feedback connections to perform online credit assignment in multi-layer architectures.Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that this model outperforms a state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning algorithm for continual learning on regression and classification benchmarks.This approach represents a step toward biologically plausible learning mechanisms that can not only match gradient descent-based learning, but also overcome its limitations.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HklfNQFL8H,Learning to Learn with Feedback and Local Plasticity,Las redes que aprenden con conexiones de retroalimentación y reglas de plasticidad local pueden ser optimizadas para utilizar el meta aprendizaje.
"In the visual system, neurons respond to a patch of the input known as their classical receptive field (RF), and can be modulated by stimuli in the surround.These interactions are often mediated by lateral connections, giving rise to extra-classical RFs.We use supervised learning via backpropagation to learn feedforward connections, combined with an unsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between units within a convolutional neural network.These connections allow each unit to integrate information from its surround, generating extra-classical receptive fields for the units in our new proposed model (CNNEx).We demonstrate that these connections make the network more robust and achieve better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.Although the image statistics of MNIST and CIFAR-10 differ greatly, the same unsupervised learning rule generalized to both datasets.Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding the computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkxSEQtLUS,Convolutional neural networks with extra-classical receptive fields,Las CNN con conexiones laterales de inspiración biológica aprendidas de forma no supervisada son más robustas a las entradas ruidosas.

"Interpreting generative adversarial network (GAN) training as approximate divergence minimization has beentheoretically insightful, has spurred discussion, and has lead to theoretically and practically interestingextensions such as f-GANs and Wasserstein GANs.For both classic GANs and f-GANs, there is an original variant of training and a ""non-saturating"" variant which uses an alternative form of generator gradient.The original variant is theoretically easier to study, but for GANs the alternative variant performs better in practice.The non-saturating scheme is often regarded as a simple modification to deal with optimization issues, but we show that in fact the non-saturating scheme for GANs is effectively optimizing a reverse KL-like f-divergence.We also develop a number of theoretical tools to help compare and classify f-divergences.We hope these results may help to clarify some of the theoretical discussion surrounding the divergence minimization view of GAN training.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],BygY4grYDr,The divergences minimized by non-saturating GAN training,El entrenamiento GAN no saturado minimiza eficazmente una divergencia f inversa tipo KL.

"Supervised deep learning requires a large amount of training samples with annotations (e.g. label class for classification task, pixel- or voxel-wised label map for segmentation tasks), which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain.During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are fed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of equal importance.However, some of the samples may become less informative during training, as the magnitude of the gradient start to vanish for these samples.In the meantime, other samples of higher utility or hardness may be more demanded for the training process to proceed and require more exploitation.To address the challenges of expensive annotations and loss of sample informativeness, here we propose a novel training framework which adaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process.The adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware strategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model.To evaluate the proposed training framework, we perform experiments on three different datasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification task and a medical image dataset IVUS for biophysical simulation task.On all three datasets, the proposed framework outperforms a random sampling method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],Byl3HxBFwH,Efficient Deep Representation Learning by Adaptive Latent Space Sampling,Este trabajo introduce un marco para el aprendizaje de la representación eficiente de los datos mediante el muestreo adaptativo en el espacio latente.

"Neural networks are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations.While existing literature largely focused on the vulnerability of learned models, we demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon that adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the input data distribution.Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarially trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution.We show this by constructing semantically- identical variants for MNIST and CIFAR10 respectively, and show that standardly trained models achieve similar clean accuracies on them, but adversarially trained models achieve significantly different robustness accuracies.This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves.Lastly, we discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],S1lFD4HnnE,On the Sensitivity of Adversarial Robustness to Input Data Distributions,"El rendimiento de la robustez de los modelos entrenados por PGD es sensible a la transformación que preserva la semántica de los conjuntos de datos de imágenes, lo que implica la dificultad de evaluar los algoritmos de aprendizaje robusto en la práctica."

"In recent years, the efficiency and even the feasibility of traditional load-balancing policies are challenged by the rapid growth of cloud infrastructure with increasing levels of server heterogeneity and increasing size of cloud services and applications.In such many software-load-balancers heterogeneous systems, traditional solutions, such as JSQ, incur an increasing communication overhead, whereas low-communication alternatives, such as JSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ scheme are either unstable or provide poor performance.We argue that a better low-communication load balancing scheme can be established by allowing each dispatcher to have a different view of the system and keep using JSQ, rather than greedily trying to avoid starvation on a per-decision basis. accordingly, we introduce the Loosely-Shortest -Queue family of load balancing algorithms.Roughly speaking, in Loosely-shortest -Queue, each dispatcher keeps a different approximation of the server queue lengths and routes jobs to the shortest among them.Communication is used only to update the approximations and make sure that they are not too far from the real queue lengths in expectation.We formally establish the strong stability of any Loosely-Shortest -Queue policy and provide an easy-to-verify sufficient condition for verifying that a policy is Loosely-Shortest -Queue.We further demonstrate that the Loosely-Shortest -Queue approach allows constructing throughput optimal policies with an arbitrarily low communication budget.Finally, using extensive simulations that consider homogeneous, heterogeneous and highly skewed heterogeneous systems in scenarios with a single dispatcher as well as with multiple dispatchers, we show that the examined Loosely-Shortest -Queue example policies are always stable as dictated by theory.Moreover, it exhibits an appealing performance and significantly outperforms well-known low-communication policies, such as JSQ(d) and JIQ, while using a similar communication budget.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],BJxN9Hvf-V,Load Balancing in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Systems with Multiple Dispatchers,Solución de equilibrio de carga escalable y de baja comunicación para sistemas multiservidores heterogéneos con fuertes garantías teóricas y resultados empíricos prometedores.

"Momentum based stochastic gradient methods such as heavy ball (HB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method are widely used in practice for training deep networks and other supervised learning models, as they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent (SGD).Rigorously speaking, fast gradient methods have provable improvements over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are exact.In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts, resulting in some practical gain.This work provides a counterpoint to this belief by proving that there exist simple problem instances where these methods cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters.These negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look like carefully constructed pathological instances.These results suggest (along with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a by-product of minibatching.Furthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which, on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and SGD's performance.This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based on a relatively less popular variant of Nesterov's Acceleration.Extensive empirical results in this paper show that ASGD has performance gains over HB, NAG, and SGD.The code for implementing the ASGD Algorithm can be found at https://github.com/rahulkidambi/AccSGD.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rJTutzbA-,On the insufficiency of existing momentum schemes for Stochastic Optimization,"Los esquemas de impulso/aceleración existentes, como el método de la bola pesada y la aceleración de Nesterov, empleados con gradientes estocásticos, no mejoran con respecto al descenso de gradiente estocástico vainilla, especialmente cuando se emplean con tamaños de lote pequeños."

"Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested.One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks.For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers.Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned.This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all?Is it important?Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance?If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence?In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers.(2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters.(3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification.(4) Pooling confers \emph{too much} deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to \emph{counteract} this inductive bias.Together, these findings provide new insights into the role of interleaved pooling and deformation invariance in CNNs, and demonstrate the importance of rigorous empirical testing of even our most basic assumptions about the working of neural networks.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJeuOiRqKQ,Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs,Encontramos que la agrupación por sí sola no determina la estabilidad de la deformación en las CNN y que la suavidad del filtro juega un papel importante en la determinación de la estabilidad.

"Deep learning models require extensive architecture design exploration and hyperparameter optimization to perform well on a given task.The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices.Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design.NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures.However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures.This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task.The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks.In this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller.Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks.We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task.We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks.By leveraging knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed models.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],SyAbZb-0Z,Transfer Learning to Learn with Multitask Neural Model Search,"Presentamos Multitask Neural Model Search, un meta-aprendizaje que puede diseñar modelos para múltiples tareas simultáneamente y transferir el aprendizaje a tareas no vistas."

"Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.

We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.  To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow.  We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.

"We review eight machine learning classification algorithms to analyze Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in order to distinguish EEG patterns associated with five basic educational tasks.There is a large variety of classifiers being used in this EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) field.While previous EEG experiments used several classifiers in the same experiments or reviewed different algorithms on datasets from different experiments, our approach focuses on review eight classifier categories on the same dataset, including linear classifiers, non-linear Bayesian classifiers, nearest neighbour classifiers, ensemble methods, adaptive classifiers, tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning.Besides, we intend to find an approach which can run smoothly on the current mainstream personal computers and smartphones.  The empirical evaluation demonstrated that Random Forest and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) outperform other approaches.We used a data set which users were conducting five frequently-conduct learning-related tasks, including reading, writing, and typing.Results showed that these best two algorithms could correctly classify different users with an accuracy increase of  5% to 9%, use each task independently.Within each subject, the tasks could be recognized with an accuracy increase of  4% to 7%, compared with other approaches.This work suggests that Random Forest could be a recommended approach (fast and accurate) for current mainstream hardware, while LSTM has the potential to be the first-choice approach when the mainstream computers and smartphones can process more data in a shorter time.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BkxmOn4FwH,Ensemble methods and LSTM outperformed other eight machine learning classifiers in an EEG-based BCI experiment,Dos algoritmos superan a otros ocho en un experimento de BCI basado en EEG

"Adversarial examples are modified samples that preserve original image structures but deviate classifiers.Researchers have put efforts into developing methods for generating adversarial examples and finding out origins.Past research put much attention on decision boundary changes caused by these methods.This paper, in contrast, discusses the origin of adversarial examples from a more underlying knowledge representation point of view.Human beings can learn and classify prototypes as well as transformations of objects.While neural networks store learned knowledge in a more hybrid way of combining all prototypes and transformations as a whole distribution.Hybrid storage may lead to lower distances between different classes so that small modifications can mislead the classifier.A one-step distribution imitation method is designed to imitate distribution of the nearest different class neighbor.Experiments show that simply by imitating distributions from a training set without any knowledge of the classifier can still lead to obvious impacts on classification results from deep networks.It also implies that adversarial examples can be in more forms than small perturbations.Potential ways of alleviating adversarial examples are discussed from the representation point of view.The first path is to change the encoding of data sent to the training step.Training data that are more prototypical can help seize more robust and accurate structural knowledge.The second path requires constructing learning frameworks with improved representations.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BylRVjC9K7,Explaining Adversarial Examples with Knowledge Representation,El almacenamiento y la representación del conocimiento aprendido pueden ser una razón para los ejemplos adversos.

"We study the evolution of internal representations during deep neural network (DNN) training, aiming to demystify the compression aspect of the information bottleneck theory.The theory suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower compression phase, in which the mutual information I(X;T) between the input X and internal representations T decreases.Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true I(X;T) over these networks is provably either constant (discrete X) or infinite (continuous X).This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works.To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which I(X;T) is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters.This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations.We then develop a rigorous estimator for I(X;T) in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models.By relating I(X;T) in the noisy DNN to an information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same class.Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that meaningful clusters form in the T space.Finally, we return to the estimator of I(X;T) employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for clustering.This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of interest.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HkxOoiAcYX,Estimating Information Flow in DNNs,"Las redes neuronales profundas deterministas no descartan información, pero sí agrupan sus entradas."

"Adversarial training, a method for learning robust deep networks, is typically assumed to be more expensive than traditional training due to the necessity of constructing adversarial examples via a first-order method like projected gradient decent (PGD).  In this paper, we make the surprising discovery that it is possible to train empirically robust models using a much weaker and cheaper adversary, an approach that was previously believed to be ineffective, rendering the method no more costly than standard training in practice.  Specifically, we show that adversarial training with the fast gradient sign method (FGSM), when combined with random initialization, is as effective as PGD-based training but has significantly lower cost.  Furthermore we show that FGSM adversarial training can be further accelerated by using standard techniques for efficient training of deep networks, allowing us to learn a robust CIFAR10 classifier with 45% robust accuracy at epsilon=8/255 in 6 minutes, and a robust ImageNet classifier with 43% robust accuracy at epsilon=2/255 in 12 hours, in comparison to past work based on ``free'' adversarial training which took 10 and 50 hours to reach the same respective thresholds.","[0, 0, 0, 1]",[],BJx040EFvH,Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training,"El entrenamiento adversario basado en FGSM, con aleatorización, funciona tan bien como el entrenamiento adversario basado en PGD: podemos utilizarlo para entrenar un clasificador robusto en 6 minutos en CIFAR10, y 12 horas en ImageNet, en una sola máquina."

"Efforts to reduce the numerical precision of computations in deep learning training have yielded systems that aggressively quantize weights and activations, yet employ wide high-precision accumulators for partial sums in inner-product operations to preserve the quality of convergence.The absence of any framework to analyze the precision requirements of partial sum accumulations results in conservative design choices.This imposes an upper-bound on the reduction of complexity of multiply-accumulate units.We present a statistical approach to analyze the impact of reduced accumulation precision on deep learning training.Observing that a bad choice for accumulation precision results in loss of information that manifests itself as a reduction in variance in an ensemble of partial sums, we derive a set of equations that relate this variance to the length of accumulation and the minimum number of bits needed for accumulation.We apply our analysis to three benchmark networks: CIFAR-10 ResNet 32, ImageNet ResNet 18 and ImageNet AlexNet.In each case, with accumulation precision set in accordance with our proposed equations, the networks successfully converge to the single precision floating-point baseline.We also show that reducing accumulation precision further degrades the quality of the trained network, proving that our equations produce tight bounds.Overall this analysis enables precise tailoring of computation hardware to the application, yielding area- and power-optimal systems.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BklMjsRqY7,Accumulation Bit-Width Scaling For Ultra-Low Precision Training Of Deep Networks,Presentamos un marco analítico para determinar los requisitos de ancho de bits de acumulación en los tres GEMM de entrenamiento de aprendizaje profundo y verificamos la validez y el rigor de nuestro método mediante experimentos de evaluación comparativa.

"Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising avenue to enhance the performance of deep neural networks on a target domain, using labels only from a source domain.However, the two predominant methods, domain discrepancy reduction learning and semi-supervised learning, are not readily applicable when source and target domains do not share a common label space.This paper addresses the above scenario by learning a representation space that retains discriminative power on both the (labeled) source and (unlabeled) target domains while keeping representations for the two domains well-separated.Inspired by a theoretical analysis, we first reformulate the disjoint classification task, where the source and target domains correspond to non-overlapping class labels, to a verification one.To handle both within and cross domain verifications, we propose a Feature Transfer Network (FTN) to separate the target feature space from the original source space while aligned with a transformed source space.Moreover, we present a non-parametric multi-class entropy minimization loss to further boost the discriminative power of FTNs on the target domain.In experiments, we first illustrate how FTN works in a controlled setting of adapting from MNIST-M to MNIST with disjoint digit classes between the two domains and then demonstrate the effectiveness of FTNs through state-of-the-art performances on a cross-ethnicity face recognition problem.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BklhAj09K7,Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Distance Metric Learning,Una nueva teoría de adaptación de dominio no supervisada para el aprendizaje métrico a distancia y su aplicación al reconocimiento de rostros a través de diversas variaciones étnicas.

"Spatiotemporal forecasting has become an increasingly important prediction task in machine learning and statistics due to its vast applications, such as climate modeling, traffic prediction, video caching predictions, and so on.While numerous studies have been conducted, most existing works assume that the data from different sources or across different locations are equally reliable.Due to cost, accessibility, or other factors, it is inevitable that the data quality could vary, which introduces significant biases into the model and leads to unreliable prediction results.The problem could be exacerbated in black-box prediction models, such as deep neural networks.In this paper, we propose a novel solution that can automatically infer data quality levels of different sources through local variations of spatiotemporal signals without explicit labels.Furthermore, we integrate the estimate of data quality level with graph convolutional networks to exploit their efficient structures.We evaluate our proposed method on forecasting temperatures in Los Angeles.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],ByJIWUnpW,Automatically Inferring Data Quality for Spatiotemporal Forecasting,Proponemos un método que infiere el nivel de calidad de los datos que varía en el tiempo para la previsión espacio-temporal sin asignar explícitamente etiquetas.

"Training conditional generative latent-variable models is challenging in scenarios where the conditioning signal is very strong and the decoder is expressive enough to generate a plausible output given only the condition; the generative model tends to ignore the latent variable, suffering from posterior collapse. We find, and empirically show, that one of the major reasons behind posterior collapse is rooted in the way that generative models are conditioned, i.e., through concatenation of the latent variable and the condition. To mitigate this problem, we propose to explicitly make the latent variables depend on the condition by unifying the conditioning and latent variable sampling, thus coupling them so as to prevent the model from discarding the root of variations. To achieve this, we develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution not only of the latent variables, but also of the condition, the latter acting as prior on the former.

"Training large deep neural networks on massive datasets is  computationally very challenging.There has been recent surge in interest in using large batch stochastic optimization methods to tackle this issue.The most prominent algorithm in this line of research is LARS, which by  employing layerwise adaptive learning rates trains ResNet on ImageNet in a few minutes.However, LARS performs poorly for attention models like BERT, indicating that its performance gains are not consistent across tasks.In this paper, we first study a principled layerwise adaptation strategy to accelerate training of deep neural networks using large mini-batches.Using this strategy, we develop a new layerwise adaptive large batch optimization technique called LAMB; we then provide convergence analysis of LAMB as well as LARS, showing convergence to a stationary point in general nonconvex settings.Our empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of LAMB across various tasks such as BERT and ResNet-50 training with very little hyperparameter tuning.In particular, for BERT training, our optimizer enables use of very large batch sizes of 32868 without any degradation of performance.  By increasing the batch size to the memory limit of a TPUv3 Pod, BERT training time can be reduced from 3 days to just 76 minutes (Table 1).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],Syx4wnEtvH,Large Batch Optimization for Deep Learning: Training BERT in 76 minutes,Un optimizador rápido para aplicaciones generales y entrenamiento de grandes lotes.

"Designing RNA molecules has garnered recent interest in medicine, synthetic biology, biotechnology and bioinformatics since many functional RNA molecules were shown to be involved in regulatory processes for transcription, epigenetics and translation.Since an RNA's function depends on its structural properties, the RNA Design problem is to find an RNA sequence which satisfies given structural constraints.Here, we propose a new algorithm for the RNA Design problem, dubbed LEARNA.LEARNA uses deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network to sequentially design an entire RNA sequence given a specified target structure.By meta-learning across 65000 different RNA Design tasks for one hour on 20 CPU cores, our extension Meta-LEARNA constructs an RNA Design policy that can be applied out of the box to solve novel RNA Design tasks.Methodologically, for what we believe to be the first time, we jointly optimize over a rich space of architectures for the policy network, the hyperparameters of the training procedure and the formulation of the decision process.Comprehensive empirical results on two widely-used RNA Design benchmarks, as well as a third one that we introduce, show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the former while also being orders of magnitudes faster in reaching the previous state-of-the-art performance.In an ablation study, we analyze the importance of our method's different components.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],ByfyHh05tQ,Learning to Design RNA,Aprendemos a resolver el problema de diseño de ARN con aprendizaje por refuerzo utilizando enfoques de meta aprendizaje y autoML.

"Pruning is a popular technique for compressing a neural network: a large pre-trained network is fine-tuned while connections are successively removed.However, the value of pruning has largely evaded scrutiny.In this extended abstract, we examine residual networks obtained through Fisher-pruning and make two interesting observations.First, when time-constrained, it is better to train a simple, smaller network from scratch than prune a large network.Second, it is the architectures obtained through the pruning process  --- not the learnt weights --- that prove valuable.Such architectures are powerful when trained from scratch.Furthermore, these architectures are easy to approximate without any further pruning: we can prune once and obtain a family of new, scalable network architectures for different memory requirements.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],r1lbgwFj5m,Pruning neural networks: is it time to nip it in the bud?,"El entrenamiento de redes pequeñas es mejor que la poda, pero la poda encuentra buenas redes pequeñas para entrenar que son fáciles de copiar."
"Supervised learning problems---particularly those involving social data---are often subjective.That is, human readers, looking at the same data, might come to legitimate but completely different conclusions based on their personal experiences.Yet in machine learning settings feedback from multiple human annotators is often reduced to a single ``ground truth'' label, thus hiding the true, potentially rich and diverse interpretations of the data found across the social spectrum.We explore the rewards and challenges of discovering and learning representative distributions of the labeling opinions of a large human population.A major, critical cost to this approach is the number of humans needed to provide enough labels not only to obtain representative samples but also to train a machine to predict representative distributions on unlabeled data.We propose aggregating label distributions over, not just individuals, but also data items, in order to maximize the costs of humans in the loop.We test different aggregation approaches on state-of-the-art deep learning models.Our results suggest that careful label aggregation methods can greatly reduce the number of samples needed to obtain representative distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],HJlsixKqyQ,Aggregating Crowdsourced Labels in Subjective Domains,Estudiamos el problema de aprender a predecir la diversidad subyacente de creencias presente en los dominios de aprendizaje supervisado.

"Conventional deep reinforcement learning typically determines an appropriate primitive action at each timestep, which requires enormous amount of time and effort for learning an effective policy, especially in large and complex environments.To deal with the issue fundamentally, we incorporate macro actions, defined as sequences of primitive actions, into the primitive action space to form an augmented action space.The problem lies in how to find an appropriate macro action to augment the primitive action space.

"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are difficult to train on sequence processing tasks, not only because input noise may be amplified through feedback, but also because any inaccuracy in the weights has similar consequences as input noise.We describe a method for denoising the hidden state during training to achieve more robust representations thereby improving generalization performance.Attractor dynamics are incorporated into the hidden state to `clean up' representations at each step of a sequence.The attractor dynamics are trained through an auxillary denoising loss to recover previously experienced hidden states from noisy versions of those states.This state-denoised recurrent neural network (SDRNN) performs multiple steps of internal processing for each external sequence step.On a range of tasks, we show that the SDRNN outperforms a generic RNN as well as a variant of the SDRNN with attractor dynamics on the hidden state but without the auxillary loss.We argue that attractor dynamics---and corresponding connectivity constraints---are an essential component of the deep learning arsenal and should be invoked not only for recurrent networks but also for improving deep feedforward nets and intertask transfer.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],HJgyAoRqFQ,State-Denoised Recurrent Neural Networks,Proponemos un mecanismo para denotar el estado interno de una RNN para mejorar el rendimiento de la generalización.

"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples.In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear.Here we show that distributions of logit differences have a universal functional form.This functional form is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; nor does it change during training.This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation.We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD).Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness.Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity.To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10.Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rk6H0ZbRb,Intriguing Properties of Adversarial Examples,"El error adversarial tiene una forma de ley de potencia similar para todos los conjuntos de datos y modelos estudiados, y la arquitectura es importante."

"A typical experiment to study cognitive function is to train animals to perform tasks, while the researcher records the electrical activity of the animals neurons.The main obstacle faced, when using this type of electrophysiological experiment to uncover the circuit mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, is our incomplete access to relevant circuits in the brain.One promising approach is to model neural circuits using an artificial neural network (ANN), which can provide complete access to the “neural circuits” responsible for a behavior.More recently, reinforcement learning models have been adopted to understand the functions of cortico-basal ganglia circuits as reward-based learning has been found in mammalian brain.In this paper, we propose a Biologically-plausible Actor-Critic with Episodic Memory (B-ACEM) framework to model a prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia-hippocampus (PFC-BG) circuit, which is verified to capture the behavioral findings from a well-known perceptual decision-making task, i.e., random dots motion discrimination.This B-ACEM framework links neural computation to behaviors, on which we can explore how episodic memory should be considered to govern future decision.Experiments are conducted using different settings of the episodic memory and results show that all patterns of episodic memories can speed up learning.In particular, salient events are prioritized to propagate reward information and guide decisions.Our B-ACEM framework and the built-on experiments give inspirations to both designs for more standard decision-making models in biological system and a more biologically-plausible ANN.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],BJl4pA4Kwr,FAST LEARNING VIA EPISODIC MEMORY: A PERSPECTIVE FROM ANIMAL DECISION-MAKING,Aprendizaje rápido a través de la memoria episódica verificado por un marco biológicamente plausible para el circuito corteza prefrontal-ganglios basales-hipocampo (PFC-BG)

"In this paper, we find that by designing a novel loss function entitled, ''tracking loss'', Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detectors can be successfully converted to well-performed visual trackers without any extra computational cost.This property is preferable to visual tracking where annotated video sequences for training are always absent, because rich features learned by detectors from still images could be utilized by dynamic trackers.It also avoids extra machinery such as feature engineering and feature aggregation proposed in previous studies.Tracking loss achieves this property by exploiting the internal structure of feature maps within the detection network and treating different feature points discriminatively.Such structure allows us to simultaneously consider discrimination quality and bounding box accuracy which is found to be crucial to the success.We also propose a network compression method to accelerate tracking speed without performance reduction.That also verifies tracking loss will remain highly effective even if the network is drastically compressed.Furthermore, if we employ a carefully designed tracking loss ensemble, the tracker would be much more robust and accurate.Evaluation results show that our trackers (including the ensemble tracker and two baseline trackers), outperform all state-of-the-art methods on VOT 2016 Challenge in terms of Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and robustness.We will make the code publicly available.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1lzcXfknm,Tracking Loss: Converting Object Detector to Robust Visual Tracker,Convertimos con éxito un popular detector RPN en un rastreador de buen rendimiento desde el punto de vista de la función de pérdida.

"Recent empirical results on over-parameterized deep networks are marked by a striking absence of the classic U-shaped test error curve: test error keeps decreasing in wider networks.Researchers are actively working on bridging this discrepancy by proposing better complexity measures.Instead, we directly measure prediction bias and variance for four classification and regression tasks on modern deep networks.We find that both bias and variance can decrease as the number of parameters grows.Qualitatively, the phenomenon persists over a number of gradient-based optimizers.To better understand the role of optimization, we decompose the total variance into variance due to training set sampling and variance due to initialization.Variance due to initialization is significant in the under-parameterized regime.In the over-parameterized regime, total variance is much lower and dominated by variance due to sampling.We provide theoretical analysis in a simplified setting that is consistent with our empirical findings.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],B1guPVr2h4,A Modern Take on the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Neural Networks,Proporcionamos pruebas en contra de las afirmaciones clásicas sobre el equilibrio entre sesgo y varianza y proponemos una nueva descomposición de la varianza.

"Importance sampling (IS) is a standard Monte Carlo (MC) tool to compute information about random variables such as moments or quantiles with unknown distributions.  IS is asymptotically consistent as the number of MC samples, and hence deltas (particles) that parameterize the density estimate, go to infinity.However, retaining infinitely many particles is intractable.We propose a scheme for only keeping a \emph{finite representative subset} of particles and their augmented importance weights that is \emph{nearly consistent}. To do so in {an online manner}, we approximate importance sampling in two ways.  First, we replace the deltas by kernels, yielding kernel density estimates (KDEs).  Second, we sequentially project KDEs onto nearby lower-dimensional subspaces.We characterize the asymptotic bias of this scheme as determined by a compression parameter and kernel bandwidth, which yields a tunable tradeoff between consistency and memory.In experiments,  we observe a favorable tradeoff between memory and accuracy, providing for the first time near-consistent compressions of arbitrary posterior distributions.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1lSFJ34FH, A Projection Operator to Balance Consistency and Complexity in Importance Sampling,Proponemos un novedoso algoritmo de muestreo de importancia comprimido y kernelizado.

"Group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) can be used to improve classical CNNs by equipping them with the geometric structure of groups.Central in the success of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional disentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively learned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable behavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group theory.Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited to either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact groups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory).In this paper we lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and implementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups.In our approach the differential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a generic basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra.This leads to a flexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions in G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline expansions.The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two benchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides (PCam dataset) in which rotation equivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization (CelebA dataset) in which scale equivariance is important.In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their classical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group convolutions is studied in detail.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],H1gBhkBFDH,B-Spline CNNs on Lie groups,El artículo describe un marco flexible para la construcción de CNNs que son equivariantes a una gran clase de grupos de transformaciones.

"Many processes can be concisely represented as a sequence of events leading from a starting state to an end state.Given raw ingredients, and a finished cake, an experienced chef can surmise the recipe.Building upon this intuition,  we propose a new class of visual generative models: goal-conditioned predictors (GCP).Prior work on video generation largely focuses on prediction models that only observe frames from the beginning of the video.GCP instead treats videos as start-goal transformations, making video generation easier by conditioning on the more informative context provided by the first and final frames.

"When training a deep neural network for supervised image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification of class Y. Following the notation of Gong et al. (2016), we can divide features broadly into the classes of(i) “core” or “conditionally invariant” features X^ci whose distribution P(X^ci | Y) does not change substantially across domains and(ii) “style” or “orthogonal” features X^orth whose distribution P(X^orth | Y) can change substantially across domains.These latter orthogonal features would generally include features such as position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color or posture for images of persons.We try to guard against future adversarial domain shifts by ideally just using the “conditionally invariant” features for classification.In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable.We can hence not directly see the distributional change of features across different domains. We do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable.We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person.In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image.The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.We provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al.

"Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms require several steps of gradient descent to adapt to newly incoming tasks.This process becomes more costly as the number  of  samples  increases.

"Learning multimodal representations is a fundamentally complex research problem due to the presence of multiple heterogeneous sources of information.Although the presence of multiple modalities provides additional valuable information, there are two key challenges to address when learning from multimodal data:1) models must learn the complex intra-modal and cross-modal interactions for prediction and2) models must be robust to unexpected missing or noisy modalities during testing.In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels.We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors.Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction.Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data.Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets.Our model demonstrates flexible generative capabilities by conditioning on independent factors and can reconstruct missing modalities without significantly impacting performance.Lastly, we interpret our factorized representations to understand the interactions that influence multimodal learning.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rygqqsA9KX,Learning Factorized Multimodal Representations,"Proponemos un modelo para aprender representaciones multimodales factorizadas que sean discriminativas, generativas e interpretables."

"Understanding the optimization trajectory is critical to understand training of deep neural networks.We show how the hyperparameters of stochastic gradient descent influence the covariance of the gradients (K) and the Hessian of the training loss (H) along this trajectory.Based on a theoretical model, we predict that using a high learning rate or a small batch size in the early phase of training leads SGD to regions of the parameter space with (1) reduced spectral norm of K, and (2) improved conditioning of K and H.

"Deep networks face challenges of ensuring their robustness against inputs that cannot be effectively represented by information learned from training data.We attribute this vulnerability to the limitations inherent to activation-based representation.To complement the learned information from activation-based representation, we propose utilizing a gradient-based representation that explicitly focuses on missing information.In addition, we propose a directional constraint on the gradients as an objective during training to improve the characterization of missing information.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compare the anomaly detection performance of gradient-based and activation-based representations.We show that the gradient-based representation outperforms the activation-based representation by 0.093 in CIFAR-10 and 0.361 in CURE-TSR datasets in terms of AUROC averaged over all classes.Also, we propose an anomaly detection algorithm that uses the gradient-based representation, denoted as GradCon, and validate its performance on three benchmarking datasets.The proposed method outperforms the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms in CIFAR-10, MNIST, and fMNIST datasets with an average AUROC of 0.664, 0.973, and 0.934, respectively.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SJxFWRVKDr,Characterizing Missing Information in Deep Networks Using Backpropagated Gradients,Proponemos una representación basada en el gradiente para caracterizar la información que las redes profundas no han aprendido.

"We study the role of intrinsic motivation as an exploration bias for reinforcement learning in sparse-reward synergistic tasks, which are tasks where multiple agents must work together to achieve a goal they could not individually.Our key idea is that a good guiding principle for intrinsic motivation in synergistic tasks is to take actions which affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if the agents were acting on their own.Thus, we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot be predicted via a composition of the predicted effect for each individual agent.We study two instantiations of this idea, one based on the true states encountered, and another based on a dynamics model trained concurrently with the policy.While the former is simpler, the latter has the benefit of being analytically differentiable with respect to the action taken.We validate our approach in robotic bimanual manipulation tasks with sparse rewards; we find that our approach yields more efficient learning than both1) training with only the sparse reward and2) using the typical surprise-based formulation of intrinsic motivation, which does not bias toward synergistic behavior.Videos are available on the project webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/iclr2020-synergistic.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],SJleNCNtDH,Intrinsic Motivation for Encouraging Synergistic Behavior,"Proponemos una formulación de la motivación intrínseca que es adecuada como sesgo de exploración en las tareas sinérgicas de recompensa dispersa de múltiples agentes, al animar a los agentes a afectar al mundo de formas que no se lograrían si actuaran individualmente."

"Neural network training depends on the structure of the underlying loss landscape, i.e. local minima, saddle points, flat plateaus, and loss barriers.In relation to the structure of the landscape, we study the permutation symmetry of neurons in each layer of a deep neural network, which gives rise not only to multiple equivalent global minima of the loss function but also to critical points in between partner minima.In a network of $d-1$ hidden layers with $n_k$ neurons in layers $k = 1, \ldots, d$, we construct continuous paths between equivalent global minima that lead through a `permutation point' where the input and output weight vectors of two neurons in the same hidden layer $k$ collide and interchange.We show that such permutation points are critical points which lie inside high-dimensional subspaces of equal loss, contributing to the global flatness of the landscape.We also find that a permutation point for the exchange of neurons $i$ and $j$ transits into a flat high-dimensional plateau that enables all $n_k!$permutations of neurons in a given layer $k$ at the same loss value. Moreover, we introduce higher-order permutation points by exploiting the hierarchical structure in the loss landscapes of neural networks, and find that the number of $K$-th order permutation points is much larger than the (already huge) number of equivalent global minima -- at least by a polynomial factor of order $K$.

"Network pruning has emerged as a powerful technique for reducing the size of deep neural networks.Pruning uncovers high-performance subnetworks by taking a trained dense network and gradually removing unimportant connections.Recently, alternative techniques have emerged for training sparse networks directly without having to train a large dense model beforehand, thereby achieving small memory footprints during both training and inference.These techniques are based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters during training.Thus, they are in effect executing a training-time search for the optimal subnetwork.We investigate a most recent one of these techniques and conduct additional experiments to elucidate its behavior in training sparse deep convolutional networks.Dynamic parameter reallocation converges early during training to a highly trainable subnetwork.We show that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the discovered high-performance subnetwork is sufficient to explain its good performance.Rather, it is the dynamics of parameter reallocation that are responsible for successful learning.Dynamic parameter reallocation thus improves the trainability of deep convolutional networks, playing a similar role as overparameterization, without incurring the memory and computational cost of the latter.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]",[],BygIWTMdjX,Dynamic parameter reallocation improves trainability of deep convolutional networks,"La reasignación dinámica de parámetros permite el entrenamiento directo de redes dispersas compactas, y desempeña un papel indispensable incluso cuando conocemos la red dispersa óptima a priori"

"Characterization of the representations learned in intermediate layers of deep networks can provide valuable insight into the nature of a task and can guide the development of well-tailored learning strategies.Here we study convolutional neural network-based acoustic models in the context of automatic speech recognition.Adapting a method proposed by Yosinski et al. [2014], we measure the transferability of each layer between German and English to assess the their language-specifity.We observe three distinct regions of transferability: (1) the first two layers are entirely transferable between languages, (2) layers 2–8 are also highly transferable but we find evidence of some language specificity, (3) the subsequent fully connected layers are more language specific but can be successfully finetuned to the target language.To further probe the effect of weight freezing, we performed follow-up experiments using freeze-training [Raghu et al., 2017].Our results are consistent with the observation that CCNs converge 'bottom up' during training and demonstrate the benefit of freeze training, especially for transfer learning.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]",[],HkgPMupoj7,How transferable are features in convolutional neural network acoustic models across languages?,"Todas las capas de nuestros modelos acústicos basados en CNNs, excepto las dos primeras, mostraron cierto grado de especificidad lingüística, pero la congelación del entrenamiento permitió una transferencia satisfactoria entre idiomas."

"The softmax function is widely used to train deep neural networks for multi-class classification.Despite its outstanding performance in classification tasks, the features derived from the supervision of softmax are usually sub-optimal in some scenarios where Euclidean distances apply in feature spaces.To address this issue, we propose a new loss, dubbed the isotropic loss, in the sense that the overall distribution of data points is regularized to approach the isotropic normal one.Combined with the vanilla softmax, we formalize a novel criterion called the isotropic softmax, or isomax for short, for supervised learning of deep neural networks.By virtue of the isomax, the intra-class features are penalized by the isotropic loss while inter-class distances are well kept by the original softmax loss.Moreover, the isomax loss does not require any additional modifications to the network, mini-batches or the training process.Extensive experiments on classification and clustering are performed to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the isomax loss.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]",[],rkgINf1G1m,Softmax Supervision with Isotropic Normalization,La capacidad discriminativa de softmax para el aprendizaje de vectores de características de los objetos se mejora eficazmente mediante la virtud de la normalización isotrópica en la distribución global de los puntos de datos.

"Backpropagation is driving today's artificial neural networks (ANNs).However, despite extensive research, it remains unclear if the brain implements this algorithm.Among neuroscientists, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are often seen as a realistic alternative: neurons can randomly introduce change, and use unspecific feedback signals to observe their effect on the cost and thus approximate their gradient.However, the convergence rate of such learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons.Here we propose a hybrid learning approach.Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide.We provide proof that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of networks.In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match the performance of gradient-based learning.Learning feedback weights provides a biologically plausible mechanism of achieving good performance, without the need for precise, pre-specified learning rules.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]",[],ByeUBANtvB,Learning to solve the credit assignment problem,Las perturbaciones pueden utilizarse para entrenar pesos de retroalimentación para aprender en redes neuronales totalmente conectadas y convolucionales
